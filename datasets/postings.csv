hiking,"&gt; I meant there was a social-cultural practice on the part of euro- descended Americans for a long time of not doing prescribed burns on our vast public lands and instead allowing fuel to build

Euro-descended Americans didn't even have access to the entire continent until like 1900. I don't know how they would have ""managed"" the land out west, in 1865 or so when Euro-Americans were barely even there. Plus, when it is a wilderness, nature should be the one to manage the land... not humans."

hiking,The climate has chsnged since the dawn of time. I do agree we are accelerating it with overpopulation and pollution but there's a statistic that 3% of corporations cause 71% of the pollution.

Controlled burns and people not being morons is a better way to prevent wild fires.

hiking,Quite the opposite for me. What exactly makes you feel depressed?
hiking,"I meant there was a social-cultural practice on the part of euro- descended Americans for a long time of not doing prescribed burns on our vast public lands and instead allowing fuel to build. This in conjunction with patches of clear cutting and conifer monocultures. All that and other things have contributed to the wildfire situation we have today. 

You're correct that not all Native American practices were sustainable, and I never claimed they are a monolith. However regular prescribed burning as I understand was somewhat common among most if not all western US tribes. Not sure about midwest and eastern tribes/bands. At any rate that burning, which took many forms, was combined with seed spreading, hunting, and horticultural practices to maintain populations over millennia. Some ecosystems and places with high concentrations of biodiversity may not have existed without those practices."
hiking,It‚Äôs not that scary if you‚Äôre okay with some exposure. There‚Äôs a chain link to grab for most of the final section. The worst part is the crowds and dealing with other hikers who can move quite slowly

hiking,"If it snows where you are, and you want to buy something for four seasons, then boots make sense. If not, then shoes are usually a good call. It really comes down to fit. If you're going to be in wet areas I'd take a look at Oboz. Best sole in all conditions I've worn and really comfortable. Salomon has some really specific shoes/boots for different conditions too. They can get pricey but if you're not buying in a store, the online gear sites are filled with ""last years model"" and you can save a lot. Just remember that fit and comfort is what it's about. And in a lot of cases you do get what you pay for."

hiking,This looks epic! How was  it?
hiking,"Heh...depends on the ""mountains.""

If it's up on Mt Victoria or Robson, or even parts of the trail on Temple, I'd say boots. Can be snow you need to kick steps in, can be lots of deep scree that would be bad even in mid lows (I prefer trail runners and low boots like Moabs, but not for Canadian Rockies off trail stuff).

It's not ankle support (boots don't help that much until you get to plastics or ski boots), it's having a stiffer sole for rocky bits, the ability to do a bit of edging in scrambling situations, the ability to traverse snow and kick steps, and the ability to keep scree out. So like light mountaineering boots say.

But if just on a trail there, with no snow, then approach shoes and trail runners work great."
hiking,"It's not easy to see, even from Lone Pine, as much of it is hidden by nearby peaks and ridges. And not that impressive, to be honest.

It's set back among high stuff so you have to be kind of due east to see it, although maybe from some peaks in the southern Inyos it would be more visible. If you play around with Google maps in 3d view you'll notice the problem pretty quickly."
hiking,"Please don‚Äôt feed wildlife. Read up on leave no trace. Especially the section on how to treat wildlife. https://lnt.org/why/problems-we-solve/wildlife-at-risk/

 But people will say ‚Äúoh it‚Äôs just one bird‚Äù but that habit sticks and there are repercussions. If you‚Äôve put this on your social media, please take it down or at least use it as a learning moment and say why you shouldn‚Äôt feed wildlife so others don‚Äôt imitate."
hiking,"Yup! I was just telling someone else in the comments that I didn‚Äôt jump over to the peak next to it cause my wife was waiting at 13000, wind started to pick up and so did the clouds. Weather definitely changes in a heartbeat up there."
hiking,"Go to your local REI or other gear shop. Tell them what you want to do, they will help you out."
hiking,ü§§
hiking,Thanks!
hiking,Thank you
hiking,"There are organizations that do guided hiking trips. Here's one such, at the cheaper end:

https://content.sierraclub.org/outings/new-trips-schedule

This too:

https://www.rei.com/adventures/p/north-america

Here's a commercial outfitter that does it:

https://www.backroads.com/award-winning-tours/walking-hiking. You probably saw this; more expensive.

Local universities and colleges often have similar outings, and often they are open to non-students."
hiking,"If you have one, go up your local REI. Ask anyone there and they should be able to help in your area. 

If you don‚Äôt have an REI, there may be other local gear shops. 

Otherwise, hiking doesn‚Äôt have to be a multi day/overnight activity. You can just go to the closest state park, find a trail and start walking. Only gear you need is your feet. Not having transportation makes that difficult. Again, talking with a local gear shop should get you some ideas, maybe even an offer to go out."
hiking,"This massively depends on your feet/legs.

I, for instance, have challenges with my feet and I love the support for both foot and ankle that I get from my heavy-duty hiking boots, when carrying overnighting gear (my boots happen to be Meinld Island Pro GTX).

Then again, for many sorts of daytrips, even my feet can deal with the situation with my trail running shoes (and actual trail running is something I never do, because of connective tissue and joint problems)."
hiking,I just use Costco low gym socks. Your shoes are gonna full with sand pretty quick so pack a few extra pairs for each hike.
hiking,"Yeah, I looked into Olancha as a place I may have been able to see it, but you just gave me confirmation that‚Äôs not the case...if only there were more than 24 hours in a day! I last saw Whitney over 10 years ago, I hope to see it again soon!"
hiking,Go early and bring sunscreen. And I say that as someone who never wears sunscreen lol
hiking,Happy 30th! I need to make it out there one day.
hiking,Injinji liner and merino wool socks just thin. Do not wear waterproof shoes.
hiking,Make sure to stop at Bryce Canyon
hiking,No I‚Äôm actually from New England but moved out here after grad school and haven‚Äôt looked back. I wish I could tell you more about the schools out here but I frankly have no clue
hiking,How was it? Spikes the whole way?
hiking,Yes!!
hiking,My favorite hike ever. Happy birthday!
hiking,"""...did I leave the coffee maker on?"""
hiking,Excellent!
hiking,"If you download the app AllTrails you can search hiking/biking paths near you. You can sort by difficulty, mileage, loop or point to point trails, and see pictures other people have taken. 

It uses your phone's GPS to guide you along unfamiliar trails, too. If you pay for the subscription, you can download the maps so they'll work without cell reception. As long as you have reception the free version works great, though."
hiking,"There's a climbers trail, that's the approach for the east ridge climb for pinnacle."
hiking,"I felt, I was in a different world when I was there, really beautiful. Didn't get to do the Narrows, hopefully someday. Happy birthday!!!"

hiking,"Thanks and yeah I agree, this was very fun!"
hiking,"Hidden Lake up at North Cascade NP has been on my bucket list for exactly this idea. If you haven‚Äôt been there yet, highly recommend!"
hiking,Awesome! Yeah I recall a pretty brutal uphill after the footbridge. Nice to do less traveled trails :)
hiking,Wow! Great place to celebrate! Beautiful!
hiking,PSA it is generally bad practice to feed wildlife. Especially for a photo op.
hiking,"Life, uh, finds a way."
hiking, Nice! I‚Äôll be there in July can‚Äôt wait!
hiking,"It really is. So much beauty. I‚Äôm lucky that I live 6 hours away, so I‚Äôm always taking trips there!"
hiking,It really is. One of my favorite places in the world.
hiking,Yes it‚Äôs open! We went in afternoon and it wasn‚Äôt as crowded.
hiking,Love that trail
hiking,One of my favorite spots in Northeast Tennessee
hiking,"Best to stay away from coton and heavy clothing. They weigh you down, absorb moisture, dry slowly, and aren‚Äôt as efficient at keeping you warm when wet/damp. Opt instead for synthetic fibers and lightweight wool (merino). Always best to have multiple light layers so you can adjust as your body heats up. I always hike with a thin wind &amp; rain shell (unless there is zero chance of weather and it‚Äôs a short hike), a merino wool t-shirt, and then mix in a synthetic long sleeve base layer and a micro fleece as needed based on weather. Always wool socks and synthetic zip-off pants."
hiking,I need to get out to Utah. This looks unreal
hiking,"The main trails in most US national parks are very popular, well signed and well maintained. Many times there are even paved for the first mile or 2. If you made it from India to the US on your own you can make it to the main attractions in Yellowstone &amp; Grand Canyon. 

Most of the guided groups I see when I visit US national parks are international tours on a big bus doing quick stops at main attractions, moving quickly through the park and staying in hotels. The Green Tortoise is a cheaper one that camps I think. Trips like you did in the Himalayas will be very expensive in the US. You can find some through REI or NOLS."
hiking,Yes!  I had some nuts!
hiking,Thanks! This looks like a good resource. I would look more into other blogs and all for planning my own trips. I definitely want to get this fear out of managing things on my own with smaller trips and maybe go on one or two guided ones for the really good ones. That would be more enjoyable as well as being cost-effective.
hiking,Yes!!!  I loved it. In had lunch at the look out. My goal is to try to camp out at most of the fire lookouts
hiking,Damn just hiked this and posted here as well and your picture puts mine to shame üòî
hiking,"I took the historic route, there wasnt too much snow (didn‚Äôt need spikes) and we had the entire summit to ourselves. Only one group of backpackers the whole day. Other than the falls trail which was packed on the way back down. (the falls trail connects to the el cap trail)"
hiking,yes a few days ago
hiking,Ok I love the idea of hiking but I've always been a little unsure of what to wear...what should one wear on a hike like this?
hiking,They reopened the upper hike!? I was there last year but part of it was blocked off from damage to the trail
hiking,"There are facebook group for most states named like 'Hiking California'. They could answer you more specifically.

Trails here are usually pretty easy to follow, a guide is not really needed. You should get some used gear and go for some small trip like 1-2 days to get used to it. Have fun!"
hiking,My favorite hike in WA!
hiking,"I live in the midwest and just got a pair of trail runners, hoka speed goats. They do really good for state parks that inckude rock bed, they left high enough off the ground so stepping in shallow creeks your foot will still be above water level and not get wet( 1 or 2 inches). I paired with wool socks and they dried pretty quick when I got them wet if that's your concern, or get the gore tex version."
hiking,That cat is living the life!
hiking,"Thanks for the advice! Yeah, I would definitely look into exploring the local trails as well. I am not really bothered about the difficulty of the actual trail, I have some experience even in very harsh mountainous climbs. I am more worried about the logistics, managing all the other aspects of the hike on my own, like setting up camp, cooking materials, etc. as I have never done that before. I guess I could start small and try to get more familiar with these things on my own."
hiking,Happy Birthday. Nice choice for celebrating.
hiking,"Their culture has nothing to do with it. And not all Native American tribes did it, they were not a monolith. In fact, in the western part of the US, Native Americans would drive hundreds of buffalos off cliffs. They killed more than they needed and many went to rot. In the northeast, natives burned entire forests to force out elk for hunting."
hiking,"Not OP, but I would if I could."
hiking,"Yes, if you are not a used to the altitude.   I came from Boston and went straight up for the hike.   Yikes.   O2 was an issue.   But otherwise if you can deal with the altitude and are fit enough.   Enjoy the walk and views!"
hiking,"This is true, and I'm sorry that my post made it sound like that. However its use was drastically reduced to the mass casualties and loss of land experienced by native people and a long culture of demonizing fire by private land owners and public land managers not from those cultures. That is now changing."
hiking,Haha!  Yes!  She‚Äôs definitely a 5-senses explorer!
hiking,Amazing hike. Did it two days in a row before.
hiking,I love that your kid has charcoal all over their face. Truly getting in touch with nature haha
hiking,"I'd recommend a pair of waterproof trail runners from a brand like Merrell, Keen, Altra or Scarpa. Head to your local REI and try some out.

Edit, and don't forget some good trail socks like Darn Tough or Smartwool. They're slightly padded so you'll want to wear them when you're choosing shoes to make sure you get the right fit."
hiking,"I believe this was just off Thing Valley Road, heading south"
hiking,"No problem my man! My wife snd I are avid peak baggers and have summited a few along trails in our life times.

Proud of you, keep going."
hiking,Awesome! Thanks for the info! üôåüèª
hiking,"yes, last week. The lake you can fish year around and most creeks and rivers open this Saturday for trout fishing. I recommend this hike, not hard and plenty of views and some goods spots to fish. Also there isn't to much snow! The trail is the Spaulding lake trail via fuller lake. If you don't feel like hiking you can fish at fuller lake. Oh also, Spaulding lakes main recreation area is closed, this is the backside. Good luck and have fun"

hiking,"People really, really suck sometimes. I've noticed a ton of tagging on boulders and trees as well as tons of shattered glass and beer cans around creeks and waterfall areas. 

Then if you say something to someone ""Hey man, can you please make sure you pick that up. Kids play around here."" You get shitty looks and faux tough guy attitude. 

Seriously. If you cant pick up after yourself, stay home. Amirite?"
hiking,That‚Äôs Butifule
hiking,kitty
hiking,"Yeah that does look similar, but I don't think mine would fit that canister since the male threading is on the stove itself. This stove is thought to have belonged to my grandfather many years ago so it probably isn't a knockoff but instead an old design"
hiking,How was the jerky?
hiking,Parks should require a LNT training before you're allowed entry. People clearly passed on home training. It's just basic decency
hiking,"one of the big causes of people losing their homes
is because they build in zones that are known to be wildfire prone, im not saying thats everyone that loses their home to wildfires, but if humans learned to live with nature and not on top of nature everyone would be better off. same goes to developers that continue to build in the flood plain just to make a quick buck"

Did the bird take off from your hand?"
hiking,Oh well. Guess I missed it.
hiking,"And we got stuck in a thunderstorm coming down, saw bolt of lightening hit side of cliff - I was so distraught left my boots at trailhead - had to rush down through thunder and snow ... went back in September and it was perfect conditions."
hiking,"And yes, I did angels landing and it was lovey"
hiking,"The river canyon was the Narrows! It was probably too cold or frozen in December, but you can rent the gear I was wearing (a waders suit, waterproof socks and shoes) for $60 and it helps"

hiking,"As long as you are willing to pay a few hundred dollars, you can get a guide exactly like you're describing for any national park, and many state parks. Prices vary by location. 

For a 3 day trip through [Yellowstone](https://wildlandtrekking.com/trips/heart-lake-mount-sheridan/), for example, this company offers trips for $1000/person. That's what I would consider reasonable. For a lesser-travelled area, trips may be closer to $150/day/person. 

The company above includes all tge gear/supplies/food you'll need into the cost. If you go with one that doesn't, places like [REI](https://www.rei.com/rentals) will rent you gear, and other sites too that you can google for your area.

Also, check blogs and Reddit for info, it's easy with all this info available to plan your own trips, and save up for guided tours of really gorgeous or remote areas. 

Good luck!"
hiking,"This civilization is going down at high speed when we have no choice but to put such signs, very sad :("
hiking,Right!  Most of them nearby were.  It was eerily beautiful

hiking,Where was the river canyons? I went there few years ago and I didn‚Äôt know they existed. However it was December. Did you go up Angels Landing?

hiking,"I didn‚Äôt prepare at all for it, to be honest. I just googled ‚Äúbeginner 14ers‚Äù and picked this and hiked right up. Turns out, there are no easy 14ers. It was a challenge but I was committed and wasn‚Äôt stopping until I reached the top no matter how long it took me. I would suggest you start off really early in the morning and to check the weather up to the day of. Pack tons of water and snacks, take many breaks if needed. It‚Äôs not a race but a personal achievement. Wish you the best! Hope you get to see the amazing view."
hiking,Snow lake in Washington
hiking,I'm thinking about trying this in June but don't feel prepared at all.  How tough was it?
hiking,Thanks!
hiking,Maybe after he was hit by a truck.

hiking,Perhaps the best entry level hike in the Whites. Great scrambles.
hiking,Congratulations!
hiking,Awesome! Are you training any to prepare or are you just going with the flow?
hiking,New Hampshire might be my favorite place in the world
hiking,"Wow! For reals?! Man, that makes me even happier that I hiked this. I‚Äôm definitely happy of having this hike under my belt. I appreciate the information!"
hiking,"I stayed at Zion Ponderosa Ranch Resort on the east side of the park and it has great camping and glamping sites to pick from. There‚Äôs a ton of activities and it‚Äôs nicely managed. It‚Äôs about a 35 minute drive through the park to the visitor center but the ride is super pleasant. There‚Äôs also some campgrounds around the visitor center but I‚Äôm not sure how to go about getting one of those. I recommend calling the park, they are super helpful. 

And I know you‚Äôve heard this but go SUPER early. For everything. Earliest shuttle, earliest parking, earliest dinner. Crowds are killer but you can plan around them. 

The parking lot fills up around 7 and the only other places to park are $30 a day in town.

Some other things- the park pass is $35 for 7 day access. The narrows and angels landing will get crowded but they are so worth it. The other hikes are hit or miss, I‚Äôm doing Deer trap and Cable Mountain today so I‚Äôll report back. 

Outside of the park and Springdale there‚Äôs nothing. Seriously it‚Äôs empty. But as for other hikes / things to do. Check out lake Powell, Antelope Canyon in Arizona, or Bryce Canyon! 

Have fun!"
hiking,September 18th. Forgot I was on this group and decided to post last night while I was reminiscing.
hiking,"National parks are great and you should definitely plan to visit them but don‚Äôt discount the stuff that‚Äôs close to you! Getting started can be difficult and state parks typically have well-maintained and well-traveled trails that are easy to walk/navigate on. Additionally, you might be surprised by the beauty they have to offer. They also typically have cheap or free campgrounds available. So while it is advisable to find partners through forums like this one or local clubs, it is possible to get started on your own in less rugged terrain near you. Btw, I‚Äôm also in the Midwest and would be down to help as I‚Äôm looking to get back into backpacking. If you‚Äôre anywhere near 61313 feel free to PM me and we might be able to link up."
hiking,"Thanks! Yes! I‚Äôm so proud of myself and it‚Äôs definitely something I want to continue doing. You‚Äôre absolutely right, it‚Äôs addicting."
hiking,"I think we got pretty lucky, not at lot of people made it to the top."
hiking,"I wish, my wife was waiting at 13,000 and it was starting to get late and clouds were starting to form so decided to play it safe"
hiking,Quite.
hiking,It was definitely a life experience. I‚Äôm looking forward to doing it again!
hiking,It was my very first time trying a 14er. Do people prep for this?
hiking,I was there Monday and was actually  surprised that it wasn't super crowded. It's a beautiful and majestical place and you captured some great shots!
hiking,I forgot I was on this group and forgot to post. This was from back in September if I‚Äôm not mistaking. Thought I‚Äôd share since I was going through my pics last night
hiking,"""Its horrible seeing the loss but its nature.""  
But the increasing rate at which these forests are burning down and the sheer scale is an outcome of climate change. The question is whether the erormity of these fires is doing more damage than the ecosystem could ordinarily recover from.   
(Just speculating, I'm no expert)"
hiking,"LOL some flex and comfortable GAP khakis, Columbia sweater and Columbia waterproof jacket. Man, this was my very first 14er, I had been looking at weather forecast and reading how much stuff changed depending on elevation so I had to be this prepared. My first 14er and didn‚Äôt know what to expect."
hiking,Just got married at the Temple of Sinawava a few weeks ago. Already wishing I could go back. Great pics!
hiking,"Saw a lot worse than that visiting the otherwise beautiful river canyons in the foothills just East of the S. San Joaquin Valley, Oakhurst on down.    Large river boulders completely covered with paint, rock faces marred with graffiti, piles of garbage dumped.   Cigarette butts discarded in dry grass, smoldering barbecue charcoal just dumped.   Wouldn‚Äôt return to such blight.   What kind of human cockroaches would so despise and deface such natural beauty?   Are they ever held to account?  There are still parts of the West where locals wouldn‚Äôt tolerate this being done to their public lands."
hiking,"As of right now, the crowd was manageable. But I can definitely see it getting terribly crowded in a few weeks. Try to aim for a week that kids are in school (if possible) and that will help. 
I know this is the most common advice given but it‚Äôs so true- get there early! The free parking at Zion visitor center fills up pretty much immediately, so plan to get there at 6:00-6:30. Otherwise parking in town is 30$ a day. 

Also the shuttle tickets are tricky to get, but you can also bike into the park if you can‚Äôt get one. They have e-bikes to rent that are super fun."
hiking,"Welcome to the club, it‚Äôs addicting"
hiking,Where are the other hundred hikers?  Lucky to have that summit so uncrowded.  Weekday?
hiking,I‚Äôll tell you who.... rapscallions
hiking,"At the beginning, it was definitely crowded. But after about 3 miles the majority of people turned around and there were only a few other couples and single hikers that spaced out pretty nicely. I was pleasantly surprised!
The narrows is usually closed this week of the year, so maybe there were less people than usual. We got super lucky!"

hiking,"Yep, before European contact Native Americans used fire constantly as a tool to actively manage the land. A lot of biodiversity and open habitat exists because of tens of thousands of years of such management. Controlled burning is a huge part of the landscape in the western US and I'm glad we're starting to re-apply it once again. Wildfires that reach up into the crowns of trees and cover millions of acres should be rare, not an every-year occurrence. Controlled burning can get us back to that being a rarity, especially with various tribe members sharing their knowledge."

hiking,"Road approaching Neversink River area in foothills of the Catskills in rural Sullivan County, NY.  This is a special trout river, you can barely get at it. In fact, it's where fly fishing was invented. You cannot casually drive to this place.  It's a full two hours from NYC and you need GPS to even hope to find it.

The hillside in the woods approaching a state parking lot was absolutely buried in garbage. It looked like a Brazilian favela or the kind of squalor that they put on TV when asking you to donate money.  The drainage ditch was full of diapers soaking up runoff water and there were plastic water bottles and cheap fast food containers everywhere - like styrofoam clamshells, stuff that hikers don't use and it's about 20 miles from any real source. Look deeper into the woods and there is garbage ABSOLUTELY EVERYWHERE.

People are far too kind when trying to describe what's been happening. The ghetto has been coming to the countryside and shitting all over it, just like they do in the ghetto. That's why it's a ghetto. It not the streets; it's the people in them."
hiking,It's totally not that bad! We have over 300 days of sunshine here and the cold is dry instead of humid and bone chilling. Our snow is like snow globe snow-- light and fluffy!

hiking,Where is this?
hiking,"Its not even shitty honestly.

I did some time as a wildland fire fighter for the us forest service, and honestly the vast majority of wildfires I got called out on could have easily been prevented by controlled burns. The reason people lose homes is because people think fire is big bad and scary. Its a beautiful natural process that can be contained by proper due-diligence.

Sure there were random freak fires from lightning and such. But really, controlled burns would help A LOT in ways most people don't even think of."
hiking,Exactly. It's horrible seeing the loss but its nature. After the australian wildfires they said some species of plants that were laying dorment for years sprouted after the fires. Shitty as it is its the circle of life.
hiking,Damn you're hella cute
hiking,"No, just no."
hiking,"Most people don't realize that wildfires need to happen in order to replenish the land. In fact some species, like the Ponderosa Pine, can't propagate unless their cones are subjected to something like 300‚Å∞F.

I love visiting burn scars and seeing the vegetation coming back. The shoots, the grasses, the mosses, even the weeds."

That is the highest peak on the Continental Divide and the Continental Divide Trail, (which in Montana crosses triple divide pass, where water flows either to the Pacific, the Atlantic or the Arctic oceans) as well as the highest in the Front Range.

Congratulations on a noble quest.

Stay safe and stay well, if I am lucky enough, I might see you on the trail some day. See you at the Top."

hiking,Probably not...
hiking,"I've noticed SO much of that shit recently during covid!

People who normally wouldn't ever visit wild places are suddenly going to them and they have no idea how to behave in or respect where they are.

It's like it's just another blank slate for them to defile and despoil.

I was hiking the Franconia ridge trail last summer in the White mountains of New Hampshire and I couldn't believe all of the trash, graffiti and the impromptu ""toilets"" with toilet paper all over the place!
I had hiked that trail so many times before and I had never seen anything like it. 

It made me so sad and angry!

I hear you!"

hiking,Looks so peaceful
hiking,"You'll be fine! That being said, if you're using new gear I would do a single overnighter first, with a plan to get back to civilization for any adjustments.

But you'll survive, regardless, even if you don't.

If you're really worried about it, get a Garmin inreach for emergencies."

hiking,Holy saturation batman!
hiking,"Depending on what you are doing it's not just walking as someone suggested. Plenty of things to consider. Spend some time researching and prepping, get on YouTube and watch some folks vlogs about what they do for cooking, water, rain/cold. A weekend trip not far from a town with cars nearby is different that a possible isolated scenario where no one knows where you are or when to expect you.

Where is your next meal coming from? Next clean water? How much water are you going to carry on you? Food safety/animal/bug safety? Have an emergency plan if you get an injury like a phone, is there service there or have a Garmin? You can prep within a month, but you do need to prep"
hiking,Beautiful part of San Diego. Hard to beat the view of Anza-Borrego from PCT on  Mt Laguna!
hiking,Spectacular photos.  I had no idea Colorado looked like this.
hiking,Looks like it'd be a scramble [a ways off trail](https://i.imgur.com/0Bpy38A.png).
hiking,Is Observation Point still closed from rock fall?
hiking,Tahoe rim trail plus part of the PCT (they are connected/the same thing for a lil bit).
hiking,People who do stuff like that and scatter trash ruin it for everyone else. When it gets so bad places get closed to the public.
hiking,"Hey, thanks for responding! I‚Äôm coming from Orange County and would be going up on the 14 North, I believe that takes you to I-395 right? So I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs somewhere closer from Lone Pine where I can still see Mount Whitney clearly."

hiking,"My biggest concern if I were you would be planning the resupplies. I've done week long trips but I've never done anything long enough to need a resupply.  It's not something that would worry me much though. 

Otherwise, from a planning and preparing standpoint I'd feel comfortable in your shoes doing this trip. Plan exit strategies, make sure people know where you are, all that normal stuff you should do on a shorter trip anyway. 

The above assumes your previous experience was similar to what this trip will be. Meaning you planned or helped plan the trip, you carried all your gear with you, etc.  I only say that because some boy scout groups only ever hike to lodges and other such places where they only need to carry clothes and snacks but can leave the sleep system and full meals at home. That's a very different kind of trip."
hiking,The lighting in your pics is fabulous!
hiking,"Indeed it has, ski slopes around me didn't do so hot this winter"

I‚Äôm 6‚Äô 180lbs, he‚Äôs 5‚Äô5‚Äù and skinny, we had our packs with us, but it was very tight, we were only in the tent together to sleep. If you can deal with that, then it is a good choice, if not, I agree w the other posts that you should look for a 3p tent."
hiking,"oh good idea about the outline, thanks!"
hiking,"Yeah I've bought MSR twice (2p, and 3p). The 2p was a while back and I can't recall the model, but the one that replaced it,  is Elixir... Which is what I have for 3p.

The reasoning was: 1) didn't want to spend too much. 2)Had to have two vestibules - for keeping gear. 3)The floor area was the largest compared to all others. I am 6ft, wife is 5'4...we found it roomy in the 2p.  

With that said, the REI quarter dome/half dome would be my next choice."
hiking,Alamere falls down there
hiking,Cool! I haven't been up to the White Mountains myself but I know that snow can last up there til summer
hiking,Ooh la la that sounds amazing! Wishing you two all the best
hiking,"If you've done overnights, and feel comfortable, there's no reason it won't be the same. Just a whole lot more of it and every day. In terms of getting in shape, you won't be the same hiker when you end that you were when you started. Where you head is at is going to be the make or break. Just roll with what's presented and you'll be good to go."
hiking,Thank you!! We‚Äôre horseback riding in garden of the gods and then we‚Äôve got a couple hikes mapped out to do. I‚Äôm beyond stoked! We‚Äôre coming from Florida so the cooler weather will be a nice change haha

hiking,Blue lakes in silverton
hiking,No they‚Äôre from last summer/fall. The mountains are still covered in snow currently but should be melted by June. For RMNP hmmm I‚Äôd probably check out the loch/lake of glass if you‚Äôre trying for a longer hike. glacier gorge is also great for a little shorter hike
hiking,Looks like a knockoff of the Snow Peak Gigapower.
hiking,"I‚Äôm sure that if the human species had never lived on Earth - if we had been Martians for as long as we‚Äôve been around... We would look at Earth and declare it to be heaven. We‚Äôd send rovers and submarines over in rockets so that we can explore the most beautifully intricate place in the solar system. But we didn‚Äôt, we‚Äôve familiarised ourselves with this magical place and now we‚Äôre killing it. Happy Earth day üåé"
hiking,"I have a 2p Nemo hornet. Just to give reference I am 6'2"" 280. But I can't even fit my pack inside my tent, much less another person. I would lay out the dimensions of your choices on the ground and try and get your stuff in the outline.

I think using a 2p for 2 people plus packs is unrealistic."
hiking,For 2 and gear you will want a 3p tent. A 2p without gear will be tight for 2.
hiking,"In the end it‚Äôs all just walking.  

Take your time, use your brain, listen to your body and go walk."
hiking,"As someone who thru-hiked it last year, I wouldn't describe it as ""timid"". It is relatively short, but it actually has more elevation change per mile than the continental divide trail which cuts through the rockies.

That being said, you should definitely go for it! It's a once in a life time experience and most people struggle to find the time with work. 

My best tip for new thru-hikers is you don't need all the shit you think you need. Get that pack weight down."
hiking,Adventure cat!!
hiking,I love seeing all He created! Let‚Äôs give praise to the creator God!
hiking,Love this hike... relatively easy and quick to a beautiful place. Going to the Upper lake however..... kicked my ass.
hiking,"Well, get a good pair of shoes or boots because you're going to depend on them about as much as anything. I have put some miles on my hokas but not with a heavy pack.

Also, start planning on what type of food your going to carry and how often you are able to restock along the trail, account time for going into towns if necessary.

You're gonna hurt after a few days but it should go away baring any physical problems you might have. Just be careful and listen to your body, have a bail out plan."
hiking,"get the guide book, it's excellent. Once you have the hang of signage, and as long as you pay attention, you'll be fine. There are some somewhat challenging climbs, and some areas where other state park trails and such spin off, so it's really easy to get off the main trail if you aren't paying attention or miss a junction. My mom did a thru hike of this when she turned 60, and is not something who I'd say was in terrific shape. Not bad shape, but she's not naturally a physically active person and she did just fine once she had the right equipment. Despite how nice spring can be though, the climate around Superior can vary SO much. One day it'll be 85, the next day 50 with heavy, dense, frigid fog rolling off the lake. So you have to prepare for quite a variety of weather conditions. Even in July it can be that way (lived in Duluth many years) but you probably already realize that if you live fairly close. I love visiting Duluth but I hated living there despite loving the lake. The weather is just far too tempermental for me. I used to leave town frequently because all around Duluth, it would be sunny and in the 80s, and then it would be 50 in the city thanks to the lake and fog. I wasn't prepared for it when I moved there though I grew up in NE MN and spent plenty of time near the lake."
hiking,Damn that‚Äôs gorgeous
hiking,"We‚Äôre going to Colorado for our honeymoon in two weeks, I‚Äôve been once before but my husband hasn‚Äôt.. I‚Äôm so excited to go back!! üòçüòç"
hiking,Made an edit for a secondary location it may be! Hopefully you can find the place!
hiking,Thank you for your help!

Edit: Could also be Tokaloo Rock."

hiking,"My feeling is that boots are more about being in the snow, crossing shallow streams without gaiters and keeping rocks out. There's a lot of shoes that have similar soles/stability (like the Oboz Bridgers) if you're carrying some weight or are going to be spending a lot of time on rock. A lot of people immediately say trail runners but, while I have some, I'm not in that camp. Comfortable, light but limiting. And I personally like a firm sole where I'm not feeling every rock. So if four seasons isn't a big deal, I wouldn't worry too much about the ankle support element. Shoes should be fine."

hiking,"Nothing like alpine lakes, imo.   
Yup, you get all kinds of blue (and green) water."
hiking,Continental Divide Trail runs right through there. Part of the trail probably follows the road for a bit.
hiking,"I believe there's a chunk of the CDT (Continental Divide Trail) trial there.  Most likely folk walking that north bound.

hiking,I know the general area but can‚Äôt think of why there would be hundreds of folks out there.  Odd
hiking,Honey !!!!! We are moving to Colorado !!
hiking,Where is the second pic?

hiking,Best state!
hiking,I had no clue it was earth day
hiking,Yeah I've got a list of first aid stuff to bring and I'll do a couple test camps. I'm also going out with the 12kg pack and walking for a few hours. Once I can walk this 10 mile path near where I live with my pack at 15kg for 5 days in a row and not injure myself I'll consider my fitness to be good enough I think.
hiking,[deleted]
hiking,"That's a lot of good gear recommendation thanks! I'll be sure to test some shorter trips as well, mostly to determine hammock or regular tent which I'm still on the fence about. I'm sort of building up walking with the bag which is at 12kg right now on a 10 mile route so hopefully I won't have endurance issues."
hiking,Thank you! I‚Äôm trying to get out there this summer. I‚Äôm from Colorado but shamefully haven‚Äôt made it out that way!
hiking,Shout out to Red Rock Canyon Open Space in Colorado Springs!!

hiking,"&gt;Just an easy way to make a fire

That's what I meant. Under the shown conditions anyone could start a fire or am i too optimistic?

&gt;In Sweden, at least, firewood is very often missing at the fire sites.

But having dry trees and the tools you carried that's not exactly a problem.

Nevermind. Cute video."
hiking,"And if you put on more ""Kindling, the thinnest twigs"" then no ax is needed either."
hiking,Yep.
hiking,"Not horrendous. There were about three stages - first mile and a half was wonderful. Weather was perfect, legs were fresh, trail wasn‚Äôt steep. Stage two started about two miles in where I put my spikes on due to the snow, mud, general calamity. That lasted until right after the tree line on Little Haystack. Stage three was HOLY CRAP WHERE DID ALL THIS WIND COME FROM. I JUST FELL ALL THE WAY TO MY HIPS IN SNOW? IM GOING TO DIE. That lasted until the hut where I sat down and recovered. Back to stage two where we just had rocks and general snow and then stage one where my generally positive demeanor returned because I didn‚Äôt die and the weather was nice again. 

All told, not that bad."
hiking,There's no branding other than the design on the head of the stove. No idea how old since it was found in my garage but I'd suspect at least older than 25 years
hiking,"Absolutely I think so. The video was not intended for any survival situation. Just an easy way to make a fire if you walk along hiking trails. In Sweden, at least, firewood is very often missing at the fire sites."

hiking,"I have hiked all over the world, but this remains one of my favorites"
hiking,"I use OSMAnd, I think it's probably worth paying the couple dollars a month for when you're using it.  It lets you download topo maps of the area then so you can see you route on the map as you're tracking (without needing cell service). 

Tutorial would be something like ""importing GPX file to google earth"".  But the gist is, track using app, it will record to a GPX file.  Find GPX file on your phone (or share from app if you can).  Transfer to computer.  Open with Google earth.  Or I think you can get it into ""google my maps"" too.  

Lots of apps can open a GPX file.  Including the app you used to track it so you could get your friends to download OSMAnd as well, or one of the other offline navigation apps, share your GPX route with them, and they will be able to see the route and follow it on an offline topo map on their phones.

If you google GPX tracking hiking you'll likely find a lot of info."

hiking,Thank you!
hiking,thinking about proposing to my girlfriend here whilst we are in the area next week. Would you say the spot you took the video from is pretty much what I should be aiming for? Looking for the best backdrop but dont know what you were standing on here. Thanks for any help!
hiking,"Does anyone ever struggle to start a fire when you have a saw, an axe, a barbecue grill and a device to create sparks (or just a lighter) under perfectly dry conditions with an abundance of wood in all shapes and sizes?"
hiking,"Man, do I love an inversion."
hiking,"Thank you! Do you recommend any of these apps over the others, like for my specific purpose that I should start with, and can be done with the free app version?

Is it easy to export/view in google earth? I will try to find a video tutorial/example to go by."
hiking,Wow!
hiking,reminds me of this band called hallas
hiking,It should be a psa of how to not go to joshua tree
hiking,Mountains views are awesome and it‚Äôs even better with the ocean in the distance.
hiking,Nearly freezing here in SC this morning
hiking,"I don't see anything about getting anything lost at all. Just a guy being a jerk and calling his girlfriend a dumb botch.

Not sure what that adds to the community."
hiking,"Strava (turn off public sharing), Gaia, OSMAnd, CalTopo and others are all apps that will track your route to a locally stored GPX file using your phone's GPS.  You can see the route in those apps on a map and you can also export and view in Google earth."
hiking,"That‚Äôs really interesting! For context the air temperature here was around +10¬∞C, we hadn‚Äôt had any significant rain for five or six days though the lower parts, off the rocky plateau, were still a little boggy."

hiking,"Gorgeous country up there.


Some cool history about the area.

hiking,Yup! This was taken a couple of miles before Spring Creek.
hiking,"Only face, where trail?"
hiking,That is a great hike! I'd have thought there'd be more snow up there still though. How muddy were the trails?
hiking,Took a trip to Greenville last weekend and was amazed at how green everything was already compared to northern Virginia. I was not enthused by the amount of pollen everywhere though
hiking,"What is kind of weird is that, at least superficially, the landscape in the photo looks a lot like the landscape of far NW Nevada and far NE California where I hike in the intermediate elevations of the desert when the higher mountains are deep in snow.  Enough that it would take close looking to distinguish photos of one from the other.   Yet climate and precipitation amounts are doubtless very different."

Bring spikes with you, the ropes aren‚Äôt gonna help much with the vertical hills. Couple days before I went, i read on alltrails that cops were coming up to the top of the stairs to give out tickets. I was scared but I went anyway. It was a sunny Monday and there was no cops. Just make sure to ask people coming down. Best hike of my life so far!"
hiking,How did you know?
hiking,Not the best trail ever - there are some sections with quite a lot of vegetation and the last part is fairly steep - but also definitely not the worst. There are ribbons so it's pretty easy to follow. I'd recommend continuing to Sharp Peak afterwards!
hiking,"No, I've never been. How difficult is the trail up? Is it well maintained?"

hiking,"How lucky to go there!! 

At the time we were there, swimming was never in the books, because of severe cold and wind. I am sure the water will be little chilly even during summers, but I would recommend other smaller beaches in the area as opposed to Grotto for swimming."
hiking,We landed day passes this morning too!! Can‚Äôt wait to finish planning out our hikes now that we‚Äôve secured passes. We will be applying for the Half Dome permit when the time comes!!

hiking,10 miles is 16.09 km
hiking,"Hi, commented on your post over in Survival, so if it helps I can answer these questions too. 

If you haven‚Äôt camped or hiked before it‚Äôs a really good idea to do some one or two night trips before the big trip, to make sure you have what you need and know how it works. 

Simplicity is key, and carrying only what you need. I‚Äôll give you my typical packing list so you can look some things up. My tent is a Tarptent Rainbow, one to two person, with bug netting and built in groundsheet. Weighs just under 1kg. In mild weather I use two 7mm closed cell foam sleeping mats, from Decathlon, about ¬£5 each. They fold easily for packing and one goes under my tent groundsheet to protect it, the other inside. I use either a down sleeping bag (Mountain Equipment, bought used off eBay, down bags last for decades) or a lightweight down quilt (Sierra designs Backcountry 40). 

Your clothes need to be comfortable, lightweight, fast drying. And not too many! Two pairs underwear (lightweight anti chafe synthetic boxers) two t shirts (Danish Endurance tencel, don‚Äôt get smelly) , three pairs socks (Danish Endurance running socks), Mountain Hardwear lightweight nylon trousers, North Face nylon sun shirt, Berghaus fleece jacket, Marmot waterproof jacket, Gore-Tex Paclite waterproof trousers, Merrel Moab Ventilator shoes or Nike Flyknit trainers. Sun hat, fleece hat, nylon shorts, foam flip flops or sandals. Everything is fast drying so I can wash and wear. 

Don‚Äôt try to hike too far too soon. No
more than 10 miles a day at first. Blisters are common if you overdo it so take it slow and carry compeed blister pads. 

You‚Äôll need a good torch too, the Petzl zipka is great. If you want to be more stealthy with your camping you can use a bivy bag like the Alpkit Hunka. Much lighter but not so good in wet weather. 

There are often good packs on eBay, you‚Äôll probably need something 45-65 litres depending on how much food you‚Äôre carrying and how compact your sleeping bag is. Ultralight hikers often use frameless packs to save weight but I‚Äôd advise you to get one with an internal frame and a comfortable hip belt. There‚Äôs a very nice Osprey Aether 60 pack on eBay U.K. right now, orange, used, low auction price. You‚Äôd be happy with that.

I don‚Äôt usually use stoves now myself, but the simplest and lightest would be a basic alcohol stove under a titanium or aluminium pot. 

The best solar panel I know of at the moment is the Anker Powerport. You hang it on your pack."
hiking,"At the beginning I said it that ""I knew it was a long hike"" without saying where I was starting from and then I realised that was a stupid thing to say so I edited it out. I didn't add where I am starting from because it's a long way and I kind of wanted to avoid people putting me off basically. It will take a month I think and I'm not really following a trail, just sort of going in a direction and wild camping where I can. if that sentence makes you want to put me off then I was right to leave it out XD

Also I can see why the type of bag or clothes I take might depend on the length of the hike but the other two questions aren't that trip specific in my opinion so if you know the answer to those that would be nice."

hiking,A lot of trekking poles breakdown with shock cords and you can just pack them in your checked luggage. That's what I did when I went to Zion. The whole park is amazing BTW.
hiking,There's dozens of us
hiking,I have no idea how to answer any of that because I have no idea from your post what trail you're intending to do. You've given basically no information whatsoever. Please rethink then ask again in a specific manner.

hiking,What parts of TN? GSMNP? The AT through the Roan Highlands? Both good choices. In June is the Rhododendron Festival at Roan Mountain. With elevations around 5800-6000 feet the temperature can be not too terrible even in June.

hiking,"I've been hiking in the mountains of New Mexico regularly for the past 21 years, and New Mexico has the most lightning strikes of any US state, bar Florida. There's been one time where I was deathly afraid of being struck by lightning, so it is a real concern.

What happened was much as you describe. I made it to the summit around noon or a beautiful blue sky day, and shortly after I started heading down, I heard thunder far off in the distance. Another mile or so hiking down, the sky started getting dark and then it started raining, and of course more thunder. At this point, my first thought was to head down as low on the mountain as possible, so I started running downhill.

I was in the middle of a forest, so avoiding trees was not possible, and some people were huddling against trees (which I didn't think was wise, since if a tree is struck the charge can go down on the surface of the bark to the ground). 

One lightning strike was so close I was momentarily blinded by the intense light, felt the charge on my skin and hair, and smelled the electrical smell in the air. I think the strike was mere metres from me. I didn't stop to find out.

I did make it down unscathed, but this did put the fear in me. I now avoid being high up in the mountains after noon during monsoon season (July through early September here).

I honestly don't know what the absolute best choice would be, but I would suggest **not** being on a ridgeline, and not being next to isolated trees."

hiking,Wooooow
hiking,"Nope, but I did stay in a Holiday Inn Express last night..."
hiking,Ahhh I did this in college! What a great picture and awesome trek all-around.
hiking,"At 5 seconds the storm is a mile away from you. Sound travels with like 330m/s through the air, in 5 seconds that would be 1650m which is around a mile I think."
hiking,I just use a Platypus in a normal day sack.  I feel it's way more flexible.
hiking,"When your hair is standing up and you can give your buddy static shocks or the rocks are buzzing RUN downhill. When you stop getting shocks in your teeth from your fillings you can probably stop. Good chance you will be getting hammered by hail about then so the trail will be getting slippery. If you have a 1970‚Äôs external frame pack I would ditch that, but what‚Äôs the point of ditching a normal pack? Pull that over your head to fend off the hailstones."
hiking,"Ok. But you've never been in a lightning storm on granite or up high, have you? Could be wrong. Don't think I am."
hiking,What‚Äôs the story to this place? Is it a neighborhood or just one property? Looks like a great place to explore.
hiking,You get used to it eventually and it just turns to nostalgia. I see pictures of Deschutes County and Silver Creek Falls all the time on here. That's my childhood.

Last year I saw two trees take out a huge chunk of the bridge. It's not very safe to cross anymore but I still take the risk. :)

hiking,"Agreed. National Parks have become a cheaper vacation spot for family‚Äôs and I don‚Äôt blame them I would take nature over Disney any day. Specifically shuttle tickets at Zion, Yosemite passes and Rocky Mountain NP vehicle passes are short impossible. To me at least."
hiking,There are still a bunch of passes for end of May and all of June. I just snagged one.
hiking,Beautiful!
hiking,This title has such gentle wistfulness about it...
hiking,"Yeah...no.  Being stuck above treeline in a storm is extremely serious.  If you don't think it is, you should probably stay away from mountains."
hiking,"That depends on the park and what you are trying to get.

Each park is different, but most release in month long blocks anywhere from one to six months in advance.

It really sucks, but without any development into additional capacity and continued ad campaigns, there really are not any good solutions here."
hiking,"&gt; RMNP in the beginning of June   
&gt;  
&gt; no skills dealing with ice

You won't have a lot of options. There will still be a lot of snow there. The park will also be very wet from all the meltwater, and patches of snow you find may be undercut by meltwater.

You might be able to do Emerald Lake, but you'll probably have to stay around the lower areas of the park."
hiking,I don't know dude. I've been caught in some pretty wild lightning storms on trips. When you start hearing sizzling a little pee can come out.

At the same time of the year, I went to the nearby Indian Peaks Wilderness. There were still frozen lakes there."
hiking,You should. Just one suggestion. Stay anywhere in Chefchaouen but Riad Baraka. The people who run that place really are not very nice. I'm not joking. ha ha.

hiking,"If you're hiking with a golf club, this is your best bet."
hiking,"Use your best judgment on how close the lightning sounds to stop hiking down. Sometimes it really is the best option to spread out, sit on top of your pack, and shelter in place rather thank march further into the storm. The main goals are to be low to the ground and have as little of your body touching the ground as possible."
hiking,"It's still snowing in the plains and in Denver! Very snowy spring, it's been rather cold"
hiking,"Getting lower matters more when you're above treeline or on an exposed ridge. And running is a good way to screw up. No need to run. Rule of thumb is to count the time after you see lightning. 30 seconds or less when you hear the thunder and you should be considering where to go. If it's five or six seconds, the storm is a couple of miles away and you should start looking for a spot to ride it out. There's more than enough on line on how to do that. Definitely want to stay away from water and solitary, tall trees. A tent is not the place to be but, if it's not safe to get out then yeah. Crouch on a pad. Gotta' keep anything metallic away from yourself."

hiking,Oh no! It really is a dry area (the irony being that Carvins Cove is the water source for so many homes in this area). I hope you felt better quickly!
hiking,Wow beautiful
hiking,That is not what they are talking about. They re talking about how no one can enter Yosemite at all without a permit to do so.
hiking,You need an entry permit to enter Yosemite at all. These are acquired through recreation.gov
hiking,"This was my first time there, really enjoyed the Olympic Peninsula!"
hiking,Is it STILL snowing like that there ? Went to emerald lake last week and everything was still frozen over. Just curious because i went to RMNP 4 years ago and it was not this cold and snowing in april of 2016 in fact there was already some blooming wildflowers.
hiking,"Ahhh I loved this trail too, so much fun."

hiking,"I‚Äôve hiked in all four, and I would have to say that Utah and Colorado have the most dramatic views overall and are just generally more beautiful. But if your looking for a more intimate and possibly more relaxing experience Tennessee is a good choice. Although I think North Carolina has better hikes than Tennessee."
hiking,Science!
hiking,Thanks very much!
hiking,Thank you!
hiking,Good to see some Florida trails. Thinking about hiking down that way Spring of 2022
hiking,"depends on what they mean by day pass.      


but... generally speaking you have to pay to enter national parks(there's various monthly/annual passes, or discounts/free entry for certain groups).      


if you want to hike or camp, you tend to need a permit,  which either requires a reservation,  or ... i think they've shifted to an online lottery system.    


not 100%  but think you can do day hikes without any special permits(which is what i mean... a ""day pass""  could mean buying a 1 day entry into the park),   but if you intend to camp,  or hike multiple days,  or if you're targeting any of the popular trails, you'll need a permit."
hiking,"Walmart has some Levi‚Äôs that are around 20$, light weight, moisture wicking, and flexible. I think they are called cargo pants, but they‚Äôre a straight/slim cut. Very comfortable. I‚Äôll be getting more of them soon."

hiking,Holy shit that is one stunning shot.

hiking,Was an amazing day thanks babe xxxxxxx
hiking,This has to be the inspiration for Rick's dream crapper(Rick and Morty Y'all).
hiking,"I'm biased since I'm from Utah, but I'd say Utah. Arizona is already hot as an oven by June, and I'd imagine Tennessee is blazing by that time as well. Southern Utah, where the mighty 5 are, would probably be around 95-105 maybe with the exception of capital reef np. However northern Utah, which is just as beautiful, would have highs in the mid 90's in the valley and very temperate mid 70's to 80 in the mountains. My personal favorite in the summers is the Uintah mountain range, very temperate and the only range in the US that goes from east to west rather than north to south. Fair warning about the Uintah range is that it can get moderately cold at night. Best advice is make a list of places you want to go and google the average temperature at these areas for the time you plan on going there."
hiking,My pleasure üåöüñ§

hiking,I‚Äôve been really looking into the zip offs but then I randomly started getting ads for scrubs and that‚Äôs why I asked if that was a comparable thing.. honestly maybe my phone was listening to me talk about stretchy pants that are sweat wicking and somehow the algorithm threw scrubs my way üòÇü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
hiking,"I've seen people use non-standard items to hike, but not scrubs.   The REI events I've been attending suggest synthetics top and bottom.  My experience has been that they dry fast, are more versatile, have vent flaps, sun protection, etc.  I wear convertible hiking pants.  I don't often unzip them into shorts, but man is it a big convenience when I do.   If you don't need something that's the highest performance, I'd just buy whatever synthetic hiking pants are on sale wherever.   I think you'll prefer them to cotton once you get some."

hiking,"Hello! I am looking at doing section E of the GDT this summer over 10 days and I've started to think about my food too recently. Mostly dreading bringing so much of it. Below is what I have previously done for 9 day stretches. Is this the best or healthiest meal plan? Absolutely not. But it did the job for both speed and space efficiency. 

From my memory here is roughly what I ate everyday:

\-2 Cliff bars each morning first thing before leaving camp

\-Instant coffee as I hiked

\-1 or 2 Snicker/Cliff Bars/Almond Butter Squeeze Packs (The Justin Squeeze Packs are really packable and 200 calories a pack) a couple hours in

\-Lunch was always tortilla with mayo, hot sauce, cheese and a tuna pack. If I ran out of tuna I'd use nut butter instead. I would also eat some candy like skittles or something

\-Afternoon snack was the same as morning snack, something I could eat while walking

\-Dinner was a rotation of Ramen noodles or Idaho Potatoes with Cheese and sometime mayo and hot sauce added. I often added olive oil to my ramen to add calories. Afterwards I sometimes made hot chocolate or ate some more candy if I still had some. 

My shopping list was somewhat like this for 9 days:

\-About 3 boxes of granola bars (Clif and Lara were my favourites)

\-1 Box of Justin's Almond butter packs 

\-A pack of Snickers

\-A block of hard cheddar cheese

\-A bag of tortillas 

\-As many mayo, mustard, hot sauce packs from fast food places as I could muster

\-A little squeeze bottle of Olive oil

\-Instant Coffee

\-Mio Squeeze bottle for electrolytes

\-9 Tuna packs

\-4 Ramen packs

\-5 Packets of Idaho Potatoes

And then I would throw in random candy that I thought wasn't that heavy or hot chocolate packs. 

I'd say I was eating roughly 2400-2800 calories per day, depending on my snack consumption. I was also on the PCT and I was deliriously hungry at this point, so I don't think I'll bring as many bars or snacks this time, because I don't think I'll work up my appetite to that point. I'll probably keep the same eating schedule though. I may switch to oatmeal for breakfast instead, because I won't be doing such long days this time. 

Also this subreddit has actually good meals you can make, if you want to eat more diverse hiking food: [https://www.reddit.com/r/HikerTrashMeals/](https://www.reddit.com/r/HikerTrashMeals/)"

hiking,"At the risk of sounding overly negative, unless you really know what you're doing and what you're letting yourself in for, I'd advise against it.
The Cuillins can be spectacularly dangerous, and while the route Google gives is moderately ok (by Cuillin standards at least), it's pretty much the only safe one, and it wouldn't take much of a navigation error for the falling and screaming to start.
Also, (although I haven't done the sums), that feels to me to be pretty ambitious for a day walk (unless you're staying overnight at the bothy).
Sorry for being such a negative Nessie, but wouldn't want you going on without at least a bit of a warning."

hiking,I just tried a pair on at MEC this weekend. Fairly light boot and seems to provide support. I really wanted to like it however it did not even come close to fitting my wide feet. It was their ‚Äúwide‚Äù version however it still ran narrow (in my opinion)
hiking,you just have to have the park pass thing in your car

hiking,Touche
hiking,SPECTACULAR! üëèüëè
hiking,"Glissading down the first 3000' or so of elevation loss was super fun. Glad I brought my rain pants. BUT, people who skiied were able to go all the way from summit to parking lot which would be amazing."
hiking,How was the ride down? We did it last October and all I could think about was how much better it would have been to ski down.
hiking,Nice photos !
hiking,Shhhhh don't tell people
hiking,Awesome to hear! I will definitely be doing one or the other within a year
hiking,Do you need permits?
hiking,"Oh last 1/4 mile is very fine ash/sand(?), Basically one step up one step down. I didn't have poles but I don't think that would help significantly. Standing stationary would result in sliding down."
hiking,"They are way too close.  When cornices go, they often take several feet of ice past the overhang with them.  If you aren't at least 10ft back from the edge, you're probably too close.  Some of the cornices on the southern aspects of the Crater can have 10ft overhangs, so you're looking at more like 20ft back to be safe."
hiking,"Blue bird typically means a clear day after recent snows, ie: powder day with blue skies.  This does look like a nice spring day up on St. Helens, though."
hiking,Appreciate it. This sounds very similar to the end of the Sahale glacier trail (upto the campsite) in the North Cascades.
hiking,"Easy to navigate going up, a little harder coming down since pole isn't exactly obvious against rocks, but hard to get lost. I am an experience hiker so I didn't need much (usual trail shoe + food/water). Partner was less and she used poles. Crampons not needed in September, but definetely needed in early summer. Lots of hat and sunscreen, no shade out there.

Pro tip, marked trail is not always the easiest way to go up, I would suggest not climbing up if you see another path going around."
hiking,"Thanks!

Is it difficult to navigate or is the trail well-marked? How much equipment do you recommend (approach shoes, poles, crampons, etc)?"
hiking,Tadoussac* is what I meant. And ok cool! Nice picture.
hiking,"I used to live on the other side too. Fly on over! Or better yet, drive"
hiking,I was covered up head to toe. Pale skin probs
hiking,"It‚Äôs not the same region, but it‚Äôs quite close though!"
hiking,"My only other time was in late September- so technically fall, but it had gotten a fresh snowfall. I got to experience a little bit of the ash/shale and I'd say hiking on snow is a hel of a lot easier. Also less dusty/dirty.

With the ash, you can't really give yourself extra traction whereas climbing on snow with microspikes or crampons, you can make steady forward progress without any backsliding"
hiking,Lol yeah just missed.
hiking,"Stunning photos, wow."
hiking,"West coast mountains are much more dramatic-looking, that's for sure"
hiking,False summit is soulsucking
hiking,[removed]
hiking,"How am I supposed to go about my life normally with the knowledge that this place and my own state are technically part of the same country, I just live on the boring side"
hiking,South Africa
hiking,Western cape south africa. Close though
hiking,Yes. I wish.
hiking,This picture just gave me sun poisoning
hiking,Yes. Yes it is.
hiking,"Jealous!!!!! Well done! 

Can I ask, have you climbed it in summer as well? I‚Äôve only done the summer summits and was planning to start training for bigger ones n winter starting with Helens, but I‚Äôm curious as to the difficultly and what changes in shale vs snow?"
hiking,Looks like a tough hike
hiking,"I did it last summer, let me know if you need more info. Around 8 miles, I can send you my gpx data. Not too difficult until the last 1/4 mile - that was hell."

hiking,no one hikes there... it is all switch back all the way up... it was nice
hiking,"They ha e picnic areas in national parks for a reason, use those. Do not go off trail in sensitive areas.

It is also illegal to take any rocks, plants, animal byproducts, etc from national parks, so don't."
hiking,5 miles is 8.05 km
hiking,"If you're aware you and your friends are loud, go out of your way to be quiet on the trail. People that project their voice 5 miles away or use a speaker to play music are jerks. Follow leave no trace and check out the park website beforehand. I also just want to point out that a national park might not be the best place to casually have a picnic. People have to eat on the trail of course, but it's not like a picnic energy. It might be more appropriate and fun to go on a local park hiking trail."
hiking,haha
hiking,Until a heavy storm at least. :)
hiking,"It's more than likely that the north Cascades in the States has 10x the population of BC. Aside from the lower mainland, BC has almost no people. So less people to post about it on Reddit."
hiking,Loved this hike - one of my favorite National Parks!
hiking,"I‚Äôm saving for wool base next winter. I can say that wool socks seem to be much better at regulating temp and almost never smell,"
hiking,Looks like Yosemite. There is half dome.
hiking,this a real place? wtf
hiking,Doing it in two weeks!
hiking,"Not sure which circles your in. While alpinisim isn't popular the hiking makes the front page of reddit fairly often. Garabaldi Park is well known, and of course Whistler. There is also Joffree that gets a lot of attention. 

The one big gap is there are very few well maintained and easily accessed multi day backpacking trips. Lot's of there and back overnighters, but there is a need for more remote trail building to connect numerous trails together."
hiking,Location ?
hiking,"Depends.

On some of the trails in that heavily used park there really aren't a lot of good spots to pull off, like some of the nature trails and trails around the big trees. Often fencing anyway. But on other trails, like Redwood Canyon, or even Crescent Meadow, sure, find a place out of the way of everyone's view etc and you can have a nice picnic. Basically don't hog a public area. 

And BTW, you can't ""hunt rocks"" in a national park if said hunting means collecting."
hiking,"Yea, Mailbox Old Trail is pretty brutal. Lots of high stepping. I've only taken it down, not up"
hiking,"No.  If there are trails, stay on the trails."
hiking,"Going off trail, even slightly, is a big deal. This is how single track trails end up being 25 feet wide. Stay on the trail even if it is muddy, or icy.  If you don't want to get muddy, run around."
hiking,"Don't go off trail. Most parks have picnic areas somewhere in them. Use them. 

Don't be loud. People head into nature to get away from the loudness of life. 

Don't litter. Pack out more than you pack in."
hiking,"I'd recommend National Forest. If I remember correctly, NF sounds most of Sequoia NP. Google ""leave no trace""."
hiking,"The Boulder field and up wasn‚Äôt bad last time, it was the trail up that killed me. Lots of huge steps/washouts killed my energy.

So excited for this trail!"
hiking,"Don't take any souvenirs from the parks apart from pictures and whatever you buy at the gift shop. That includes flowers and rocks. One or two little things might not seem like a big deal, but if you get parks with thousands of visitors every month, each just taking one or two little things, it can add up pretty quick."
hiking,Oh no! Well hope you can make it back again!
hiking,You will see incredible views even if higher elevations aren‚Äôt accessible!
hiking,Love it!
hiking,"Many Glacier road (where this hike starts from) won‚Äôt open to even bicycles/walkers until may 28 due to road construction so it likely won‚Äôt open up to cars until mid to end of June I am sure! And the plowing is pretty on schedule to where it normally is for going to the sun road from what I have been told, so don‚Äôt think it will open up much earlier than normal either!"
hiking,It‚Äôs not too bad! To get all the way up to the glacier (a couple miles past this spot) is about 11 miles round trip and about 2000 feet gain over that full 5.5 miles but I didn‚Äôt really feel the gain much!
hiking,"How to not be annoying in any national park:

1) Stay on the trails, for your and your friends‚Äô safety, if nothing else
2) Look for ‚Äúpicnic areas‚Äù or ‚Äúday use areas‚Äù for hanging out in. 
3) Don‚Äôt litter."
hiking,Literally my favorite color!!
hiking,It definitely is really hard to get a bad photo!
hiking,"Appreciate you asking. The reason going off trail is frowned upon is because of the damage it can cause to plant life. But there will be more than enough spots in dirt or on rock you'll be able spot from the trail to have a picnic. You do need to be super careful if you're around water that's running swiftly. Not something to play with. Drowning is not uncommon and it's no way to go. What you do need to remember is to leave ZERO trace that you were there. Also, rock hunting is bad mojo. And illegal. You can't take anything from a national park. So please don't. And in terms of ""loud?"" Again, not cool. It disrupts others. If you let the quiet and calmness of being out there run the show, then you won't feel the need to be loud. Just groove on it. That's what you're there for. Have fun."
hiking,"Phone cameras can be impressive, but are not capable of doing everything a camera can. If you think you want to print large photos to hang on a wall and remember those hikes, go with a camera. I have a Nikon Z50 and it is perfect for hiking. If you just want to share the memories digitally and have no plans of making prints, stick with a phone camera."
hiking,Thank you for your quick n helpful response!
hiking,"10 miles RT, total gain is about 4500'. It has sections where scrambling is involved. https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/mount-st-helens-monitor-ridge"
hiking,"Stay near the trail.  Going off it slightly won‚Äôt be a big deal.  Don‚Äôt be loud, sound carries very far outside.  Especially this time of year.  Most importantly: Clean up after yourselves.  Anything you bring in, you pack out."
hiking,"Kinda hard to go wrong, honestly. In June I would not venture too high up...there will likely still be a lot of snow."
hiking,Thanks! I can't find details about the Monitor Ridge route. What is its approximate distance and elevation gain?
hiking,still not great but more socially acceptable
hiking,"Yuppp- I think they were a bit further away than the photo makes it look, due to the zoom lens. But yea those cornices are sketch and were especially windblown"
hiking,Would going off trail outside of a park be appropriate?
hiking,"You'll absolutely work up a sweat. It was a pretty warm day- probably around 30 at the parking lot at 4am start time, and up to mid 40s on the mountain by midday. Always hard to tell the temp with the wind, but that sun is intense. Layers and sun protection are key.

I ended up wearing just thin REI hiking (zipoff) pants, a thin soft shell jacket, and a long sleeve base layer. Honestly would have been quite comfortable without the jacket, so long as I was moving. I brought a packable down puffer for the rim but didn't end up wearing it, as fortunately the wind had calmed down."
hiking,In a national park you‚Äôre supposed to stay on the trail so you don‚Äôt damage the surrounding lands
hiking,"The final push at Mailbox is very similar- actually maybe even steeper, on average, but way shorter distance. But lots more pretty things to look up while working your way up MSH"
hiking,Aw hell yea
hiking,"I need to go back!  Went there the summer of 2018 and it was right when the forest fire started.  So, we didn't get to drive ""Going to the Sun"" road or see the other side of the park at all."
hiking,"The ""thousands of good trails"" part is tough.  Got less than one week in CO, so still Googling like mad men."
hiking,upvoted it to 420 üòé
hiking,"I always bring my Nikon with me when hiking! I like being able to control my depth of field which I can't do with my phone. The cameras these days aren't as heavy as they used to be, so it's not as inconvenient. If you're really into photography, I'd say go for it!"
hiking,"It's all good. I live in the area and have seen a lot of people drive all the way across the country just to be really disappointed that they can't camp in the park. Also...RMNP is only a tiny section of the state, so if the permits dont work out you can always just choose another place to hike.  There are thousands of good trails in CO."
hiking,"Thanks for the info! Been doing si, mailbox etc each weekend plus a few midweek hikes to prep. Hoping that‚Äôs enough!"
hiking,10ish I would say. Thanks
hiking,Thank you kindly and we will make sure to get permits
hiking,I‚Äôd say twice as hard as mailbox just because of the distance you are hiking in snow. Wish I would have gotten on the stair-stepper before lol.
hiking,Funny because I was driving past it last Friday and was thinking about how nice of a view it would be up there. Climbed it last year on May 27th with very similar weather. Glissading down was a blast. Good job.
hiking,"You need permits to camp in RMNP. If you not have them, a 3 or 4 day trip won't be possible.  Check the park website /backcountry office to see what is availablr. Please don't camp illegally, the rangers take it very seriously."

hiking,"How hot was it on the mountain? We went a few weeks ago and thought it would be much colder so we layered up were so hot! Can only imagine with this great weather that its getting warmer even at altitude. We are going again soon, what do you suggest we wear to not get too hot or cold?"
hiking,Right? I grew up in the US and had no idea the volcanos out west looked like this. Truly shocking the first time you see them ‚Äî especially after driving from the east coast for the first time :)
hiking,"Winter route is about 12mi, +5700ft. It's called the Worm Flows route and begins at Marble Mointain Sno-Park.

Summer route should be usable in 2-3 months- not positive, but it's called Monitor Ridge. I took it on my first summit hike in early Oct 2019"

hiking,That's really beautiful
hiking,Sure does
hiking,I‚Äôm 187 years old. Fingers get a bit crooked at my age.
hiking,"This was last Friday. About 6.5 hours to summit, including some stopping to switch between snowshoes and crampons, and some photo breaks. I think microspikes would be fine, but snowshoes VERY helpful for the lower areas as it got pretty slushy by midday on the descent. While we were very envious of all the people that got to ski or board down, glissading down about 3,000' of vertical (not all at once) was still very fun :)"
hiking,Yes took this picture on Sunday. Perfect weather for hiking the dunes. Still quite a bit of snow in the higher elevations.
hiking,Fantastic day. Was this earlier this year? How long did it take you to summit and did you ski or glissade down?
hiking,Awesome view. Was this a recent trip? I'm heading there this weekend and wondering about the weather conditions. Gonna camp and hike here for a day then head over to Mesa Verde.
hiking,What a great photo!  So neat to see these two flowers together
hiking,That's beautiful and all but... I don't believe fingers are supposed to bend that way ü§î

hiking,Awesome! Beautiful pictures!
hiking,"lol, my photography! It‚Äôs actually a very nice trail within the city of Winston-Salem that surrounds Salem lake. It circles the entire 365 acre lake. It‚Äôs 7 miles long, partially paved, but most of it is path and dirt. It‚Äôs a very safe trail too. 

Salem which is a old old city [George Washington traveled and spent the night in a building that still stands], merged long ago with the city of Winston, which is old in itself, but not as old as Old Salem, and it became Winston-Salem. No witch trials üòÅ, just a old historical place that use to be the home center of RJ Reynolds Tobacco, Winston Cup Racing, Hanes Hosiery, Maya Angelou, Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, Honda Jet, The River Run International Film Festival, and this hidden gem of a urban hiking, biking, running, equestrian trail."

I wouldn't recommend taking a toddler on it, but that's just me, a bit older like 6-7 would be able to handle it though

hiking,"Start by putting weight in the pack and start with the hip belt: it is supposed to sit around your waist at a height at which it can carry most of the weight of the pack. Then check how the harness sits on your shoulders... Oh, I actually just found a guide made by another backpack manufacturer, with pictures, so this will probably help more than my writing:

hiking,"I've pretty much stopped using these sport snack things. They don't really taste good, are expensive and I don't feel like I need them. Proper sandwiches are nice to have on a long day, with ample amounts of your favourite fillings.

The only exception for me is electrolytes: In hot weather, over time you'll start to lose electrolytes through sweating. If you don't replenish them, any water you drink feels like it comes straight through, as your body controls its balance of saltiness. So I sometimes use those tablets that contain electrolytes in my water."
hiking,"The difference is most apparent when you've sweated some, and then come to a stop in cool and cold conditions: you'll feel pretty cold very fast with any synthetics, but the Merino evens it out impressively well.

Also, they're fantastic on multi-day trips as they don't need to be washed nearly as often, and don't develop nasty smells.

Definitely worth a try. I nowadays only use synthetics when going on a bike ride / walk / jog / cross country ski run where I don't have breaks in between."

They might be a little pricey but well worth it for features and durability."

hiking,"Water is what you need.  Adding flavor is a personal choice to what you want. Stop every hour to drink.  If you're moving all day consume 100-150 calories every hour.  Some salty, some sweet.  When you stop for the day take in protein and carbs for recovery.  Drink a lot to fully hydrate.  Take with you what you will enjoy eating.  Nuts, dried fruit, chocolate candy bars, cheese and crackers, salami and more candy bars."

hiking,Ten pounds won't need much space so I'd probably go with something more towards the day pack size that comes with a hip belt. That'll be something she can use later. Maybe something along the lines of an extra small Osprey Tempest 20. The big thing you'll need to do is have her torso measured. She's going to grow and you want something that has decent fit now but will work a couple years down the road. Have a great time. Something very cool to introduce her to. And anything up around Tuolomne is going to be eye candy.

hiking,so cool.
hiking,"It's pretty over exaggerated how much you need those hydration supplements when hiking, people hike the PCT/AT for thousands of miles without using any of that stuff and have no issues. 

What you really need is good salty snacks, dried fruits, and enough water.

hiking,"Its a fantastic route! I'll admit I thought it was going to be a lot more difficult to plan but we simply dumped a car at either end of the range, definitely a tough days walking but that's what the chippy's for üòÇ"
hiking,"Cool great photo did this last year too, all 7 in a day and a taxi at the end back to the dam."
hiking,Very beautiful pic üôÇ the waterfalls and scenery at Yosemite Park in California was the same for me..so amazing nature isüòç

hiking,"Wanted to upload this pic I took of my two mates in 2020.
Having been in lockdown &amp; restricted to zoom calls we decided to celebrate the easing of guidance over summer by tackling the Ben Lawers Range. 

We're an avid wee group of Munro baggers so we were delighted to take 2 days to catch up &amp; complete the range.

We arrived on Friday night, camped at a local reservoir &amp; set off around 6.30am the next morning. From there we walked 2km into our first Munro:

Meall a Choire Leith. 
Followed by,

Meall Corranaich
Beinn Ghlas
Ben Lawers
An Stuc
Meall Garbh
(&amp; Finally) Meall Greigh

Visibility was fairly poor that morning, we couldn't see much more than 20 metres ahead until we reached Ben Lawers, from there on out it was possibly the most beautiful Scottish summers day I ever experienced.

It was quiet, the sun was out and we were midge free! We completed the range at around 4pm. People talk about tackling one or two Munro's from the range in a day but it's very possible to complete all 7. Would recommend this hike to anyone who finds themselves in Scotland!"

hiking,"Depends on where you go. Up in the mountains it's usually not too bad, but once you get into the piedmont/costal region it can get pretty vicious. But it's something you learn to deal with. Get good bug spray, wear long sleeve shirts and pants ect. 

Though as a side anecdote, I once took a 3 day canoe trip down the lumber river (towards the coast, about an hour outside Wilmington) and brought hella bug spray and anti bug gear (it is literally a swamp, and we went in July). But to our astonishment, we had no issues with mosquitos at all, I never even felt the need to put on bugspray. Coincidentally, I saw more dragonflies than I've ever seen in my entire life on that river, turns out that's why there were no mosquitos. Would recommend."
hiking,Thank you
hiking,Thank you
hiking,Yes. Gnat in the eye every summer hike.

There's just something about it."

hiking,"I agree,  that place is breathtaking,  thank you for sharing"
hiking,"Makes sense. We have multiple national parks in marin but I left that comment after returning home from a BBQ with some older locals from West marin. They were telling me about how the county (maybe ) eradicated all the fallow deer and wild pigs by paying professional hunters to exterminate them and burn the bodies instead of selling tags. I do really like how Muir woods has a reservation program instead of a free for all. We do a lot of trail mate matenaince ourselves because the parks don't do a great job, especially with poison oak in the winter and trash"

hiking,"Muir doesn't have anything to do with Marin really, it's a National Monument so it's technically federal land. If I were to hazard a guess I'd say it was due to Covid and restricted work in the park. In years prior the understory was always well ""manicured"" and debris from storms and humans alike was dealt with quickly."

hiking,"i personally try to not erode studied and scientific values with my personal anecdotes of what i think is right in each scenario.

to rebut your points, it is a dangerous path to justify eschewing of values because someone did it before you. a road or a radio tower has no intrinsic bearing on how wild the animals are nearby. second, animals approach food whether they are wild or not, it seems silly and lacking in perspective to me to make that assumption and carve out an exception for yourself.

LNT, no exceptions, or everyone makes just one exception for themselves and nature gets filled with exceptions."
hiking,One of my favorite hikes!

hiking,"On valentine's day I went to do a fairly short desert hike with some slot canyons and a bit of cross country skills. I had notes, a map, compass etc. My notes said while hiking up a slot canyon to find a ""native american shelf"" to climb up the canyon wall. I couldn't find it, and eventually ran into a dry waterfall too big to get up. I turned back and found a small gully that I was able to climb up. What I didn't realize was the top wasn't the top and it kept getting steeper. I ended up on my hands and knees but made it up without to much problem.

 I was now on a giant plateau but my hike was supposed to be a loop so I wasn't too concerned with getting off. I found my way across to the other side of the plateau fairly easily but then couldn't find a trail down into the main canyon. My notes indicated a smaller canyon could be used to get out as well. So I tried every smaller canyon I could find only to get stopped by dry waterfalls everytime. 

I decided to go back to the other side of the plateau, thinking maybe I could find the ""shelf"" I was supposed to use to get up. I found an old trail that seemed to go where I needed it too  but the trail washed out and there was no way I could safely go any further on it. Annoyingly from that spot I could see my car. I tried to find where I came up but couldn't find the spot. I was finally able to descend into the canyon I climbed up. Idiot me ran into a small dry fall that I could climb down but felt I couldn't climb up. It should of occured to me that I hadn't seen this dry fall earlier. I got over it only to discover the big dry fall that I'd seen earlier was all of 10 yards past it. I was now stuck inside a narrow canyon without reception. 

Somehow by sheer force of will I was able to climb over the small fall and hiked down canyon but again was stopped by a dry fall. I tried climbing partially up the walls and seeing if I could work my way around to some place I could safely enter the canyon past the dry fall but alas the walls got too steep. I ended up climbing back up to the plateau and heading back to the other side. 

At this point my shadow was getting longer and I had some concerns about water. I heard a coyote in the distance and I was aware I might have to spend the night in the desert, which sounded very cold and not something I wanted to do. My girlfriend was obviously very freaked out, but luckily I had signal on top of the plateau.

While walking along I saw a faint trail hidden behind a hill that led into a canyon but didn't seem to climb out the other side. Annoyingly I had seen this trail earlier before I had attempted to get out and had forgotten about it. This trail actually climbed into a canyon I'd tried earlier in the day but had gotten stopped by a dry falls. I let my girlfriend know that if it did leave me out it would be 2 hours or so before I would have signal. Sure enough it led right out and I watched an amazing desert sunset. 

My short 7 mile, 3-4 hour hike turned into a 16+ mile, 10 hour hike. There was a wind advisory that day which made for some harrowing moments on a few very narrow and steep ridges. And I definitely ruined valentine's day but made it up for it the next night with some homemade sushi. 

Tldr: Ruined valentine's day by climbing up to a plateau in the desert and not being able to find my way down thanks to a series of dry falls."

hiking,You literally posted a picture of someone hiking in jeans. Where's the assumption?
hiking,"I totally agree! As an avid backpacker I am aware that it is better to wear synthetic or wool to stay warm and dry. However, my boyfriend and I were 2 minutes from the car and not actually hiking, so that being said please don‚Äôt make assumptions :)"

hiking,"This is pretty random but do you use cameras that push images automatically? If not, is there interest? 

I was talking to some friends the other day and they expressed a need for something like that since it's a pain to go retrieve all the images. I looked around and didn't see any great options. I'm asking out of personal interest. Maybe it will motivate me to build a product.

Anyway cool pic!"

hiking,You could be right. Been about 30 years since I‚Äôve been in NC. But I do have a memory on a clear day looking out from some spot up in the Blue Ridge Mountains and seeing skyscrapers way way off at the horizon and my NC friend telling me it was Charlotte.
hiking,Where is this at?
hiking,Such a pretty snow waterfall. Glad that you got to see it from a safe distance instead of being in it.

I don't think the right way to build a community and expand out ranks is to tell people they're doing it wrong cuz LNT without more thoughtfully considering the context.

I'd be with you if this person was tossing a probar at deer off the cable line, but giving a bird tame enough to land on her a bite of nut is not my opening to ""educate"". That feels like a reductionistic interpretation of guidelines, not a thoughtful consideration from first principles.

hiking,"I once decided to use Yaktrax. TLDR: Don't do that.

I had hiked one 14er at the time, and my roommates wanted to do Grays and Torreys. It was October, so I knew it'd be snowy. My boots were waterproof and warm enough to handle the low temperature, but they were unusually bad with ice. I bought a pair of Yaktrax for that reason.

Instead of digging into the snow and giving me traction, the Yaktrax trapped a bunch of snow to the bottom of my boots and packed it down. One of the Yaktrax boke and fell off just a few miles into the hike, and I hadn't even noticed. By the time I noticed, the other one had already broken. Given that they had already proven to be worse than useless, I took the remaining one off and put it in my bag.

That left me high in the mountains in October with boots that had worse traction than an ordinary pair of shoes, with nothing but deep snow and cliffs for miles. I still made it to the summits, but I still had to make the descent in those boots. I probably slipped and fell over 50-100 times on that hike."

hiking,Yeah I was thinking it might be more crowded than other areas in CO being closer to Denver.  Maybe we‚Äôll try a little further southwest. Thanks!
hiking,"I did trail racing and for hiking I still use trail runners whenever I can.

The boots are still necessary for climbing, scree, snow, and slush, but otherwise I still prefer the lightness and comfort and breathing of the shoes. Even on some climbs we wear runners to do the approach. I'd start with the shoes, and see how it goes. Then get boots if you need them, especially since there is even more variety in boots than trail runners.

As for the hiking, if you have terrain like ours you did plenty of walking on your runs on the steep bits. So you should be good to go, the difference is adjusting to longer times out vs ground covered. So more water consumed, maybe need for food, etc. A big  pack is a pain, and downhills esp with it are ugh, but you'll accommodate to it. Poles help."

hiking,"This one may seem benign, but it was an ""inches from death"" situation.

We were in Red River Gorge, KY at Gray's Arch. It was early spring and there were still a lot of icicles on the cliffs. My 9-y-o son and I went over to where a row of them were dripping on the ground and I said to not go any closer than about 6 feet because you have no idea how big that ice is or when they may break off. We looked up for a few moments then backed away. When we were about 12-15 feet back, 2/3 of those icicles fell to the rocks with an impact that felt like a motor vehicle had just been dropped off the cliff. It was about a 70 foot drop and the impact would've been fatal had we lingered a step closer to where we were. 

Do not underestimate ice on a cliff."

hiking,"Didn't happen to me, but to a friend of mine.  Guy loves to do a lot of hiking, especially off trail or little explored territory.  Comfortable with 4th class scrambles to get to the tops of peaks.  A very experienced and overall knowledgable hiker.  Gets done doing a sketchy hike and is eating lunch.  Decided to do the beginner level ""nature loop"" that many parks have just to stretch the legs before driving home.  Somehow trips over a rock, slides down a slight embankment and hits his head.  Ended the day hike with a helicopter ride and a lifetime of neurological damage."
hiking,:)
hiking,"Yes it's pretty well thawed. Shaded areas will still have a bit of ice, but the 4+ miles we did yesterday were pretty well clear. And thanks! Looks like they all got very compressed though."

hiking,"I hiked to a lake in the sawtooth range. Lots of sections were scree, and large boulders of granite surrounded the lake. It was incredible. On my way back, I was hiking along side a steep slope when I started to hear something rolling. It was fast enough that I could hear it tumbling down, and big enough that I could feel it‚Äôs impact on the ground. I couldn‚Äôt see it though. It finally knocked into a tree, and stopped it. Then the tree snapped, looking up I see a tall tree begin to fall towards me. It‚Äôs frightening because you can‚Äôt tell how tall these trees are. It was a tall and narrow tree, with lots of dead branches sticking out. I immediately ran forward and when I knew I was in a safe place, I watched It crash down. It sent a large dust cloud on the trail, and left me pretty shaken up. At first I thought a boulder was tumbling down, which is terrifying because their path is unpredictable. I‚Äôm still uncomfortable hiking along slopes and every time I hear a branch fall off a tree, I‚Äôm ready to sprint haha"
hiking,"It WILL be -of just this summer season, plenty more before then."
hiking,Today actually!
hiking,"Haha, I know that feeling. It sucks."
hiking,I too was there in July 2018! One of my all time favorite hikes. While at the glacier someone pointed out some mountain goats on the super high meadows above. Quite surreal.
hiking,Looks like Ailsa Craig.
hiking,I thought that was a severed finger.

hiking,Looks like the two of you make a great team!
hiking,"I was sleeping under the stars on the Appalachian Trail and another group of hikers came into our camp. They told us that a few nights before, they were sleeping out in the open and a rabid fox attacked them. It walked right past their dog and chomped on one of their group‚Äôs hands breaking several bones.

I haven‚Äôt slept out of a tent since."

hiking,"This is the upper waterfall of the Escondido Falls trail. It took about 10 minutes of some scrambling and climbing after the first fall but it was worth it. I first went up alone since some of our group couldn‚Äôt make it all the way, checked it out myself though and then came back with a few others. Very cool to have found a path leading into the fall itself."

hiking,Pro tip! Overheated pooches on hikes sometimes refuse to drink water. I carry bread and cookies to dip in water and feed to mine when that happens. Works for pooches who live for treats.
hiking,6 miles is 9.66 km
hiking,"Not bragging at all, but my company just switched to unlimited PTO this year so I have a few backpacking trips lined up. Totally taking advantage of it. But I hope you have an awesome time. There‚Äôs a trail that leads to the main park in Zion called Hop Valley Trail, only 6 miles so if you wanted to jump into the main area you can. I loved Kolob bc it was less people but still so beautiful. If you‚Äôre experienced, you could definitely do one night in Kolob, more if you‚Äôre just doing something casual. But, I highly recommend it."

hiking,"Actually, this a very remote part of Zion, north west of the main park. So if you don‚Äôt wanna be somewhere super touristy, I would highly recommend it!"
hiking,Dude. Have an awesome time. It was my dad‚Äôs first hike. He knows I love backpacking and wanted to do something together and we had an amazing bonding trip. I hope it‚Äôs the same for you guys. This was right on the opening of Lee Pass!

Also, I'm sorry to the small dog owners out there, but I've never seen a properly trained small dog. If you're not going to train your small dog, go get a cat. They're cooler than small dogs anyways."

We will overcome though. We will be back. Maybe a little bit more hobbled but definitely more wiser. I always get happy when I see someone in Zion. A little bit teary eyed. Thank you, friend."
hiking,I meant during the winter.  It‚Äôs a destination for hundreds.  Hence the big parking lot.
hiking,That‚Äôs kinda what I thought. Thank you
hiking,Amazing
hiking,Nice. So glad you didn't cut his ears or tail
hiking,That‚Äôs a good lookin doggle!
hiking,That tongue!
hiking,Thank you so much!
hiking,I have that exact North Face quarter zip!
hiking,"It does get very crowded in the summer, especially on weekends. They're doing a timed entry reservation system again this year."
hiking,Thanks!
hiking,Go early. Pay extra for transportation in the park if you don‚Äôt already have shuttle tickets. Visit the outfitters if you‚Äôre going to hike into ‚ÄúWall Street‚Äù in the Narrows rent the gear. It‚Äôs worth it.  All the Instagram crowd will be in the beginning of the trail so it‚Äôs crowded. The deeper you go the more glorious it gets. Bring water and snacks for fuel. You will need the energy on the return. Happy Hiking.
hiking,Does Rocky Mountain very crowded? Thinking of driving out there this summer
hiking,Beautiful!!! And some pretty scenery too!.
hiking,"Looks like a great time! Also, strong squat game!"
hiking,"I‚Äôm so glad you both enjoyed! I walk a 50 pound dog 5x/week, clicker training then treat training has helped a lot. Have so much fun hiking. It rules"

hiking,I‚Äôll be there next month! Any tips for the Narrows?
hiking,Yeah well it I'm sure it would have been more popular if it wasn't buried in six feet of snow and warmer than 30 degrees lol
hiking,Awesome shots!
hiking,"Only 3!!!  Lucky you.  Trillium often has ‚Äúkeep right‚Äù signs, seriously."
hiking,"This past 4-6 weeks. I‚Äôm not 100% sure.  Just plan on snow, but mostly supportive, spring snow."
hiking,Beautiful hike and beautiful person!
hiking,"It was cold, but I rented the shoes, socks and waiters for the hike. Worth every penny. It doesn‚Äôt keep you completely dry but close enough. The biggest boost were the shoes for gripping the rocks, they are very slick. I fell once when I slipped and the current caught me as fell back into the water. It was a beautiful and rugged hike for me, 7 hours and that was only half way and back"
hiking,Vasque summit GTX
hiking,Nice pictures! I hope you two had fun. It looks like the pup was enjoying himself!
hiking,I‚Äôve seen their tracks all around the mountain except on the west flank.  But I‚Äôve not been on the west side in the snow.
hiking,You won‚Äôt be disappointed.
hiking,Breathtaking
hiking,COLORADO ROCKY MOUNTAIN HIGH!...I had to
hiking,A sweet pupper is a gear hiking partner! So happy!
hiking,Not making it there this June like we had hoped. Definitely next year. It‚Äôs gorgeous.
hiking,There is a scramble to the top of Mount Gould on your picture (the one in the middle in the background) with a stellar view on the glacier and icing on the cake you can enjoy paradise solitude up there !
hiking,I did it two weeks ago and it was 34 degrees and chest deep in places.

hiking,he seems so happy to be there with you! glad you enjoyed.
hiking,It's up 285 just outside of Bailey. Very nice trail.
hiking,Buffalo Mountain in Summit County. Will have to check out Rosalie Trail soon.
hiking,From last June. Old pictures just felt like sharing
hiking,My only encounter has been over at Ives Run. I was hiking the midstate trail and it was wildly over grown. You couldn't even see them. All I heard was hissing and i just took off running blindly hoping for the best!
hiking,Love it there!
hiking,This is great! Haha!
hiking,So... was that the end of your hike?
hiking,Been spending a lot of time up there the last few summers. Last trip I went on I think we counted stopping at around 20 lakes on a 5 day trip!
hiking,Going in November! Can't wait
hiking,Glacial and alpine snowmelt lakes are so beautiful. The color is stunning.

hiking,That sounds good. I will check.
hiking,That's good to hear. I only bumped in to 3 other people more than half a mile part the entrance gate so I was worried there could be predators around.

hiking,Is this anywhere near trillium lake? I hiked out to it with my dogs when I was visiting from LA last week and kept them on the trail and near by. They wanted to run around in the woods but I was nervous about it for exactly this reason.
hiking,I'd love to do this hike someday! I lived in Santa Fe for 3 years but I couldn't find the time to get away much for trips around the region :/

hiking,"In the Las Vegas area, a day trip to Valley of Fire and the Arizona Hot Springs hike would be my recommendations. Bring plenty of water and be aware of the weather."
hiking,Backpacking from the valley is punishing. Starting at glacier point skips a lot of elevation gain and crowds. Even better if you hike out to the valley as a car shuttle or hitchhike. With that much vertical I would do it as a day hike and backpack somewhere else away from the crowds.
hiking,We never say where are cameras are. They have disappeared.
hiking,New Mexico is so pretty.

hiking,"If you want to backpack in, you can start at Tuolumne Meadows and spend a couple days hiking down to the half dome spur trail, do the climb and then hike down to the valley.  Then you don't have to do all that climbing in one day too. But, it will take about 3 days total.  I'm not sure if your permit covers all that though."

hiking,"It's high value, not high quality. 

I'd recommend them for buying equipment from when you're first starting, as it provides a low cost to start and gets you going right away. Their gear will hold up for long enough, and is functional. Then over time you can replace whatever you want for higher quality gear."
hiking,Northern Pakistan. Fairy meadows.
hiking,"Pakistan was a pretty big tourist destination in the 20th Century, however 9/11 and the subsequent War On Terror plunged it into chaos. The terrorist attacks and Taliban that people normally associate with the country are almost pretty much dead after the army launched operations against them in 2014, and the country's reputation is now slowly growing back. It was ranked as the #1 tourist destination in the world in 2019 and it has seen a 300% increase in tourism from the years before. 

It's important to note that Gilgit Baltistan‚Äîarguably the most beautiful province of the country and where this photo was taken‚Äîwas never dangerous, even when the nation was neck-deep in The War On Terror.  It remained isolated from the country's problems."
hiking,"We have done this twice, it‚Äôs the best day hike ever and we have done hikes in 30 NPs. Take water and more water especially in August.  Yes, gloves are essential and start before dawn.  It‚Äôs a torturous hike but so rewarding.  Have fun!"
hiking,"Cool thanks! I‚Äôve got some Salomon poles that I‚Äôve used before. I currently have a Blackwolf backpack - 75 litres I think? I can‚Äôt actually conceptualise what litres converts to in packing size. 

For tent I was thinking something light but good for cold weather. Budget wise... I think I‚Äôll buy stuff overtime but getting the essentials for under 1k would be good. Is that reasonable?"
hiking,"Aw man, that makes me wistful for my days living in Raleigh. I hiked that trail weekly for years, been on that boardwalk dozens of times."
hiking,It has to be on a hiker's bucket list for sure!
hiking,Hands down! This and highline are a hiker's paradise. We saw a mama bear and 2 cubs right at the trailhead
hiking,"&gt;Also - shoes, or rather books. Currently I run in hokas and was planning to use them for multi day hikes but a lot of people are telling me to get proper boots. I could tell you oodles of information about trail running shoes but wouldn‚Äôt know where to start when it comes to boots. Any tips on a good place to start researching boots that might suit?

If you got the ankle strength/stamina for trailrunning multi day hikes in 12 hours, I guarantee that you will have no issues backpacking in those same shoes. Maybe consider trekking poles though, they help take stress off your knees with heavier loads. I only backpack in hoka speedgoats, they are great. 

Also what is your budget for a pack, sleep system, and tent? Are you looking to keep it pretty lightweight?"
hiking,Amazing view!
hiking,"No problem! Take lots of pictures! And do the cables, even if you‚Äôre nervous, I had no idea what I was getting into and didn‚Äôt mentally prepare for that!"
hiking,Thanks man! That is exactly the info I was looking for.
hiking,Is the hike back a 4 day trek too? Or are there buses like right near the Machu Picchu grounds?
hiking,"F27 - I hiked half dome a couple years ago without preparing (went with buddies who ended up having tickets) and got to the cables and freaked out, I didn‚Äôt have proper shoes or any gloves. Definitely bring a second pair of shoes in your pack that have a good grip for when you get to the cables, you‚Äôre going to be on slick granite. Also bring textured gloves to hold the cables. Lots of water and food but that‚Äôs really it. The hike is long and there are huge granite steps near the cables that were super difficult. I made it but wished I had better training for my legs, at that point you have hiked a lot of miles and then you have to do these huge steps.  

Have fun!!"
hiking,Just did the same thing on Rosalie trail! Where were you guys?
hiking,A very exhausted hiker wearing the proper outfit.
hiking,"I couldn‚Äôt even imagine! Hiking at that altitude you guys must be very fit / well conditioned! Kudos, it honestly sounds like quite the adventure, and cheers to many more for you &amp; yours!"

hiking,Hope you make it in 21/22!
gardening,So cool!
gardening,"I have a few more containers, but this is the first one that popped up."
gardening,Maybe needs repotting in new soil.
gardening,"Oh no. You or your neighbor need to sever the root &amp; install a rhizome¬†barrier, 24-36"" deep. I wanted to plant some bamboo, &amp; this is one of the reasons I didn't- its difficult to contain. The other reason I didn't is bc it attracts rats."
gardening,Gorgeous collection
gardening,The frog has melted into the banana plant
gardening,Could you elaborate on the soil? Everything ive seen has advised to prune the tomato plants of everything except the top branches and plant deep so the generate more roots.
gardening,Looks kind of like a dandelion to me.
gardening,"Provide it with the soil it grows in naturally. Peat bogs. You need to dig a hole three times the width of the root ball, put the blueberry plant in the middle, and mix in peat and black earth. Blueberries hate sandy soil. They want a soil high in organic matter that also is quite acidic. No sandy soil for blueberries, they hate it. You can supplement with acidifier mixed with well rotted compost over time."
gardening,I call them blue jays but they are probably bluebirds. No crest. We had a cat once and every time he would go outside this bluebird/blue jay would dive bomb him. It got really bad.
gardening,"Snakes love my garden, too"
gardening,"Tomatoes I start at 15 minutes in the sun and then add 15 minutes for the next few days and then go for 2-3 hours. Within about a week to 10 days you should be able to have them out for 6+ hours no problem.

This leaf might have gotten a bit burned. It's no problem as your new growth looks really good. You do need to get that plant in the ground in the next few days or repot it in a bigger container. You're going to be severely root bound already and that will stress the plant as much as too much sun when hardening off."
gardening,I thought marigolds attracts wasps which hunt aphids. Maybe they act as a decoy too.
gardening,It could be from cold damage.  Was there recent snow in your area?
gardening,"Thanks everyone! I don't know why I bother labelling these when I get it so wrong haha. Alright now I'm confused. Are there pepper plant varieties that look like tomatoes but don't have the tomato plant smell? Because I have what I was pretty sure were pepper plants growing; they look almost  identical to tomato plants with the little hairs, minus the tomato smell."
gardening,"my hollyhock just flowered for the first time, is it going to be this tall?"
gardening,Bell pepper
gardening,She will love that what's the plant in the middle it's lovely I love the color
gardening,Keep updating!
gardening,This is awesome!!!!
gardening,"If you are planting in a bucket. Don't put soil up to the top. Instead, leave a few inches 3-4 to add mulch on top. That way you can help the tomato plant fight off some of the heat that would cook it inside a bucket. Your mulch also protects the soil from sun and water damage of nutrients in your soil."
gardening,"I definitely go into the zone when I'm weeding, but I have headphones on, with lots of metal, so I don't go too far under, although the music makes it own zone too. If it's hot out, don't bother talking to me because I am far away.

Edit to add: I actually like weeding; I'm on my hands and knees, and I can see just how the plants are doing, and I get close up viewing of the bees in action."
gardening,"Wow, we grew some for the first time last year near Chicago, and they never got this tall! Phoenix weather will do that I guess!!! I wish mine got this tall"
gardening,"Ok in my garden I don‚Äôt like thistles ; they are considered a weed/pest to me .

Would you admit that a thistle is a living organism ?"
gardening,"It would be quite a beautifully diverse community you would‚Äôve moved into if you were surrounded by thousands of Iraqis. But I guess irises are the next best thing. üòú

Did the former owners leave any plant markers, labels or landscaping plans so you can ID the cultivars these are?"
gardening,No! My strawberries are blooming too. I get spring and fall berries.
gardening,"IF they are first year strawberries. You can cut some of the flowers before they bear fruit. Reason: Cutting the flowers stimulate more growth in the strawberry plant itself so that you can get a better harvest for years 2-4 of the plant.

If you don't cut the flowers. The energy will be dedicated to fruit production and you will have a smaller plant for the rest of its growth cycle.

Yes there are exceptions to this and this is mainly for June bearing strawberry plants."
gardening,"I have found the same info, I was hoping you could teach me your ways haha"
gardening,I was so thrilled to see my hollyhocks are coming back but nothing like this. I'm so jealous!
gardening,Happens all the time! Id let them mature a bit before separating. Once a set of true leaves develop gently slide a spoon (normal cereal spoon) a few inches below the surface next to the seedlings and scoop them out. You can separate and bury just to below the leaves.
gardening,Thanks for the tips. I‚Äôm going to add posts to the end of my raised bed to tie string for support. Any idea how high I should make the posts?
gardening,Def pepper
gardening,It is definitely a pepper plant

gardening,"I would say not great :( 

But if you do want to try to save them, I would pull them out of the current container they are in and put them in fresh warm dry potting soil and then put them somewhere room temp or warmer (70F/21C+) and water very sparingly. Sounds a little crazy to unpot them and change out the soil, but it's worked for me as a last-ditch rescue effort before. Good luck!"

gardening,"Saying that people are dying and I want to stop that isn't an appeal to emotion. 

&gt;how do you think that someone questioning the necessity of GMOs somehow leads to people dying ?

https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0181353

&gt;The costs of a delay can be substantial: e.g. a one year delay in approval of the pod-borer resistant cowpea in Nigeria will cost the country about 33 million USD to 46 million USD and between 100 and 3,000 lives.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5033189/

&gt;When it comes to GMO food crops, anti-GMO campaigners have thus won a remarkable yet dubious victory. They have not prevented rich countries from using GMO animal feed or GMO cotton, yet farmers and consumers in poor countries need increased productivity for food crops, not animal feed or industrial crops. Today's de facto global ban on GMO food crops therefore looks suspiciously like an outcome designed by the rich and for the rich, with little regard for the interests of the poor.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3674000/

&gt;Controlling for other factors, the adoption of GM cotton has significantly improved calorie consumption and dietary quality, resulting from increased family incomes. This technology has reduced food insecurity by 15‚Äì20% among cotton-producing households. GM crops alone will not solve the hunger problem, but they can be an important component in a broader food security strategy.

You aren't questioning the necessity. You're buying into literal corporate propaganda. The EWG isn't remotely credible because their positions regularly ignore scientific fact. Funny how your article quotes Gary Hirshberg but neglects to mention his other job.

All of those are fine when direct-seeded in the garden anyway, so the lack of seed-starting equipment is a non-issue. 


Those all benefit from cool, moist weather, which in your location is found in spring and fall. Except for the potatoes, which go all summer, they burn out when things start to heat up in July and August. 

If you're far enough north, you have a slightly different schedule than south, as your July and August may not be as hot as mine are.

The county extension office is a better source for a more specific planting schedule than the Almanac, which is necessarily somewhat general.

https://www.canr.msu.edu/outreach/county

If you're going to grow tomatoes and peppers, you need lights, or buy plants. But everything else--and that includes the warm season crops like cukes, zukes, squash, pumpkins, corn, and beans--are direct seeded too, once the soil (not the air) has warmed to at least 60F."

gardening,"It's not that toxic. Your soil is not poisoned, it does not require remediation, and your plants are in no danger. Tobacco and its products such as nicotine is not plutonium, cobalt, lead, or mercury. It's totally a non-issue.  Relax. I'm not sure where you got the idea that it's that toxic, as if it was an industrial chemical like PCBs or dioxin, or a heavy metal, or radioactive.  

  Put them in the ordinary kitchen waste trash. 

There are no plants that will ""suck up"" or uptake nicotine, which breaks down in the soil fairly quickly anyway with natural processes.

There are no toxins in your basement that will affect your plants, and any residual effects from second-hand smoke that would affect you (not your plants) dissipates as soon as the smoker stops smoking in there. 

Really, you have a complete non-issue here. Allow me to reassure you.

What you can grow in your basement is determined by how much light you have.  I can't help you with needing to get in there and access it for maintenance while there's an abusive and aggressive person in the room, but I'd strongly suggest that you just not try to grow anything down there.

gardening,"Yeah. That's a ""street tree"" habitat designed to host one (1) tree per planter. It's not really intended to be filled with other plants, too.  If you look on Google Images under things like ""urban tree street planters"", about half the people that have them opt for the zero-maintenance design choice of ""tree + mulch"", and omit anything else. 



Reasons:

1. If you put a mass planting of petunias or ivy or something in there, then they need to be hand-weeded, whereas mulch can simply be dumped to prevent weeds for  the benefit of the tree itself. 

2. Additional plantings are murder for collecting windblown trash and cigarette butts. All those candy wrappers and McDs bags and soda cups have to be pulled out by hand, by someone earning X number of dollars per hour to do so. 

3. The trees have an uphill survival battle as it is, with restricted root room, and water and nutrients availability. They don't really need additional competition.

4. Those I believe may technically be the property of the City or other municipality, same as the sidewalk. They may cede maintenance of them to the property owner adjoining the sidewalk, but they ultimately bear the responsibility for what's growing in them.  

5. I see, I guess, a couple of roses? They will not do well in the long-term, what with competition for light, nutrients, and water. Come back in 20 years and see.

6. Snow plows are also murder on planters.

gardening,I didn't either. I just got some black ones; I hope they get that big too.
gardening,Cal-Magnum Dong.
gardening,Thanks! It's Salanova lettuce. Normally grows like this just not used to it getting so big. It lettuce grows tall (like a weed) it might be due to insufficient light ( so it's trying to reach up) or lack of water (bolting to seed)

Other than that maybe it‚Äôs not getting enough water? Dawn redwoods come from quite wet regions in China and can survive standing water alike the bald cypress. Tbh it should easily survive the cold even in NE USA as they tend to thrive there and actually experience just as fierce winters in their native habitats. They will take quite a vicious pruning but I‚Äôd make sure you‚Äôve a few cuttings growing before going you go crazy with the shears."

Check out a local rose club, specific plant clubs are fantastic resources. Just be patient, it tends to skew older with more out door vs on the computer time. A week turn around for emails isn‚Äôt unusual."
gardening,"It is doing alright. I'd leave it alone. At least your plant is upright. Mine all face-planted after the cold weather. I suspect I'll see some leaf damage, too. Your bleeding heart should be in shade or part sun (morning). It should need little supplemental watering until summer hits unless you live in a hot, parched area of the earth. I'd add 2 inches of compost on top of the soil to encourage earthworms to tunnel up to get it. This serves to aerate the soil."

gardening,"I kind of doubt it. I think its just a neat thing that people do to prove they can keep it alive. I think the plants would have to at least be in the same family for that. Tomatoes are Solanaceae (nightshades) and cannabis is Cannabaceae (which includes hops and Hackberry). I think there's a hybrid potato/tomato out there made by grafting where the fruits sort of take on each others qualities. But for a weed plant to have a similar grafting, you'd have to use a hops vine or small Hackberry tree."

gardening,Thanks! :)
gardening,Goals!
gardening,"Oh, yeah, that's exactly what I was looking for!

That makes a lot of sense...its an integral.  Its affected by both the temperature above some threshold and the time held there.  So, in that sense, average temperature does have an impact.  

So, even if you can't increase the minimum temp much (simple greenhouse without insulation or heating), increasing the daytime high significantly would have an affect on early growth?  

This is based on a quick skim of the GDD/GDU...I'll go read further.  Thanks a bunch!"

gardening,"That's a relief! It's my first time starting seeds inside so I'm super paranoid I'm going to mess it up, lol"
gardening,"That's really helpful.  Thanks.  

Minimum temperature seems the more difficult to influence.  For example, a super simple greenhouse can get the daytime high temp much higher, but without decent insulation or active heating probably won't do much for the nighttime low.  Thus increasing the average, but not the minimum.  So, as with most things, not an easy answer."
gardening,Some seed kits
gardening,Little guy has  got to eat too
gardening,"Both soil temp and air temp are important. 

Plants have a unique temperature requirements for optimal growth.  It's generally a range between a high and low temps.  How fast a plant grows depends upon how much time the environment provides the optimal temperature for both the roots and shoots. 

 In agriculture this is referred to as GDU or GDD.

Last year I used a tiller, and this year, because I didn't prioritize my ammending, I had to mix it all in by hand, and it took me 10 hours a day in the garden for 3 days straight to get it all mixed. Soil is looking much better now, but still not ideal. Clay soil SUCKS."

gardening,"Minimum temperature. Most seedlings are fine with a wide variety of temperatures but cold can do them in. Or in some cases severely slow their growth, like peppers and tomatoes for example. Soil temperature and air temperature should both stay above that minimum and the difference between the two shouldn't be too big"

It's hard to talk to him further because he is emotionally abusive and physically aggressive. I have been cleaning up after him. Luckily, he's (supposed to be) leaving soon, so there shouldn't be any more. I'm going to try to bioremediate those patches of soil, so that even if I don't live here long enough to safely plant veggies in those places, at least the next tenants who might not know there were cigarette butts there won't be harmed. I'm planting sunflowers and other flowers in those places to suck up the toxins. What do I do with the stalks and foliage and everything when they die? I'm not sure what they do with the yard waste collection. Do I put them in there?

Also, the meanie also smoked in our basement for months until we caught him. What is a plant that grows with low light that can suck up lots of toxins? Ideally I would want a species that grows with both low light and low water so I don't have to go down there often, but I don't know if that's pushing it."

gardening,That's what makes the water jackets so useful. That water gets warm in the sun during the day and has a pretty substantial thermal mass to keep the plant above freezing at night. If you use them you'll find that you can play with them to narrow the hole on the top down to nothing. I keep them open normally to avoid overheating but if we're going to get close to frost temps I close the tops up to keep the warm air in.

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4pMkLGWes0) explains how to make it.

[Diluted urine](https://theecologist.org/2010/sep/22/urine-ultimate-organic-fertiliser) also works well (especially for leafy greens because it's a huge nitrogen boost, among others stuff). It's free, readily available, and is what humanity has been using since the beginning of time."

gardening,I don‚Äôt see how putting a border around it would do any harm. As long as you‚Äôre not digging it up and putting in a whole new bed you shouldn‚Äôt have any problems. If you out in like a raised bed it will be burdensome to access but other than that I don‚Äôt see a detriment.
gardening,we struggle with chipmunks and strawberries.  they eat them white and burrow.  i'm thinking about pulling the berries and giving them away.  just covering the tops would give them cover from hawks of which we have plenty

gardening,"I'm in Michigan, zone 6b and I just put together my first 4x4 raised bed garden space. Trying to hopefully get some seeds in the ground over the weekend here but I'm finding a lot of information that revolves around starting seeds indoors which is making it challenging.

My issue is that I don't have any way to grow seeds indoors. I don't have grow lights, I don't have any good spaces near windows for getting sunlight, and I don't have any of the necessary equipment like the trays to grow indoors. I know a lot of people suggest to just buy the proper equipment so I can start seeds early but considering this is my first season I'm trying to lean a bit lighter on the expenses to just get a feel for gardening.

This weekend (04/25), I was considering planting carrots, radishes, and chives. But according to the growing calendar on [almanac.com](https://almanac.com) for my area, these should have been planted at least 10-15 days prior (25 days+ for radishes...) so I'm thinking I may be too late on these? Not sure if I can still squeeze them in this late.

The following weekend (05/02), I am looking to plant potatoes, cilantro, and onions. Again according to the same growing calendar, it seems like these all can be direct sown in late april/early may so I feel a little more confident in these.

Do you guys have any other recommendations of crops that work well without needing to be transplanted to get a harvest in time?"
gardening,My 14yo pug will eat anything in the garden. I planted blackberry bushes just for him now. Age doesn't matter once they know how to forage.

gardening,"Usually if you give them a source of water they'll leave your tomatoes alone for the most part - you may still end up with a tomato or two with bites in it.

I also give them black oil sunflower seed I buy in bulk and they leave the bird feeders completely alone."

We have variegated gingers that are coming back, and we replace a couple of bushes with Crossandra, but both of those require some special attention. They look wonderful though. :)"
gardening,"there are lots of reasons tomato plants develop yellow leaves. it can be over or under watering, soil too cold, soil too acidic or base, or various plant diseases."

gardening,"Well, those things!  

The nice thing is the house sides may create a slightly warmer microclimate in the winter, so maybe it will be more like 6."
gardening,"I wouldn't till, even in clay soil, but I would add tons of compost. Honestly, I haven't had the best luck with scattering - they seem to all end up in the same place, and I have to thin out all but a couple. So I'd add several inches of compost and place the seeds where I want them, before the rain."
gardening,"Yeah, tomatoes are one of the last things to go outside. They don‚Äôt like below 55F at night."
gardening,"Thank you, I hope that‚Äôs just it. It was a hot sunny day."

gardening,Thanks for your advice I‚Äôm going to try it yours looks awesome you‚Äôve inspired me! ü™¥
gardening,"If you need to plant a lot that might work, but generally zinnias grow large enough you are better off planting single seeds at the proper spacing. They germinate really fast and at such high rates that you should get plants to grow in whatever pattern you plant.

Scattering could lead to crowding, and as I said should only be done if you intend to have a large area covered with them."

Grill and fire pit is out of the question ad its a violation of the lease. Not great for patio furniture as there's no view. This year I really want to do something with this space, so I was thinking some kind of a garden would be amazing.

INFO: We live in Milwaukee WI, hardiness zone 5b. This is a northward facing patio with high walls so very little sunlight enters here. Space is 10' x 25', as stated in the small diagram I included. I would really like to grow crops (fruits/veggies) but I know most fruiting plants require an abundance of sun to grow, so I'd really be happy growing anything but don't know where to start. I thought maybe some raised bed planters would be good but I don't know what would be happy growing in this space, or how well I could utilize this space. Please help, any advice is greatly appreciated!"

gardening,"We live in South Florida, and this time of year when it gets hotter and hotter, our regular grass dies, but the center of the lawn that is over our septic tank thrives. We get a lot of wildflowers that sprout up right there and I was just walking by today and saw the vast amount of bees, butterflies, dragonflies, etc that love our lawn. However, the rest of the lawn looks like shit and needs to be mowed. 

I was thinking of just surrounding the area that is green (over the septic tank) and just letting this spot grow wild. Well, kind of...I want to put some decorative stones around it, and will edge it and make sure that it doesn't get too wild, but I want to let it be a nice place for the insects to enjoy while still being able to mow the rest of the yard.

My husband says that if I just surround it with rocks, I will somehow ""cut it off"" from light/water/proper drainage/etc and I would need to ""raise the soil bed"" in order to make it look nice.

My first couple years swallows got the box but then I put it up in February and bluebirds were there in early March, weeks and weeks before I expected them and they kept the sparrows out.  I have read about putting a second box up ~10 feet from the first if the sparrows do claim the box so it's definitely recommended at times.   Definitely not too late for this season though!  See what happens and enjoy, that's a beautiful yard you have!"
gardening,"Not sure what zone you're in, but I'm in 7a and most of my peppers that I started on 3-7 have 2 sets of true leaves and are starting on their third.  You may not really be behind at all.

Just be careful with the fertilizer on such young plants--just do a half-strength dose if you're using a liquid kind and only do that if the soil they're growing in doesn't already have some sort of fertilizer in it.  Too much of a good thing will burn their roots and leaves."

My 17 year old will walk in the garden and bend down to weed without thinking, working out her issues with the pruning shears when she needs 'floral therapy'. My 14 year old will pick roses and loves starting seeds in tiny pots to plant later. They all accept watering and weeding chores as part if life, like laundry or washing dishes.

gardening,"My fall decorative pumpkins (not grown just bought from the grocery store to make the porch look pretty) have been a target for smashing before. 

Something about large vegetables makes some people wanna smash them?"
gardening,"You could pull and try to transplant. When I plant multiple seeds in one container it's because I assume not all seeds will germinate. If and when I do get multiple sprouts from one pot I typically snip the weakest seedling out and let the other continue growing.

If you plan on only feeding 1 family 3 plants will be enough if you aren't planning on canning. However if you want to keep all of them I'd advise trandplanting them to bigger containers soon. And you also run the possibility of damaging the roots of good plants when you go to separate them."

gardening,"I just wrote this on another thread, but I think it applies to your situation, too.

I planted moringa seeds right before a week of chilly weather (60s-70s) then read that moringa are difficult to germinate and probably won't if it's less than 80F.

I don't have heating mats or any equipment since I just start everything outside year round, and I have no access to top/back of my fridge. I had the moringa seeds planted in a large (32 oz) yogurt container - I put a ziplock baggie on top of it to keep in moisture and stuck the the whole thing in the oven with the light on. I put a temp gauge in there and discovered that the lightbulb inside my oven keeps it at 92 degrees.

Within 1 day the first seed sprouted, and the 2nd seed sprouted the following day. 

Maybe you could give this a try?"

Prior to this moment I had never thought about if herbicides are pesticides or not.  A quick look at a definition suggests to me that a pesticide is defined as something to control any pest and a herbicide is defined as something that controls unwanted plants, so it would seem a herbicide has to be a type of pesticide. But that‚Äôs only if those definitions are correct and I don‚Äôt care to look into it further."

gardening,I honestly had no idea there were so many of us!!! This brings me great joy
gardening,"Second this. Consistently hitting the low 40s at night is not ideal, but it's also not a death sentence. The plants will grow slowly and may show a little cold stress. However, as long as most days reach the mid-60s, the plants are much more at risk of permanent stunting from being potbound and light-deprived than from going outside. 

My parents always used Walls of Water in their chilly WNY garden and they worked great at bumping temps up a few precious degrees. Maybe you could DIY something similar out of plastic water bottles?"

You could still try and see if they'll grow if you put them in a plastic bag and some damp paper towel. Wait the expected amount of time for germination and if none of them sprout then they probably won't. You might want to get new seeds from a different seller or contact the company that sold them to you for a refund (probably both)."

gardening,This winter was a bit of an anomaly it is usually no where near that cold.
gardening,I kept my veggies in pots and moved them in and out still looking for a warm stretch to plant them outside of Philly
gardening,What vegetables/fruit do you like eating? I‚Äôd say start there. Size of mature plant determines size of container typically.
gardening,Bottom watering seedlings ... how deep should the water be in the 'wetting tray' and how long do you leave them in there?  I have 7 flats under grow lights and can use an extra tray for the water tray in another part of the basement ... but it seems to be kinda slow to feel them gaining water.  They are super light when dry.  I guess I am trying to figure out if I should leave them long enough to MAKE coffee or to DRINK it in the morning (5 vs 10+ min).
gardening,Hahahaha
gardening,That‚Äôs when you need to upgrade from fake to real.
gardening,Keep in mind if your planting is next to a building &amp; still has a good amount of afternoon sun the cold will not settle like it would out in the open. Thus increasing it's cold tolerance by 10F. You can also spray with an anti dessicant like wilt pruf to protect the canes. I wouldn't prune back the dead wood until early to mid summer. In early spring in northern climates you would prune back more than needed seeing the tree appears more dormant even in late spring. Threadleaf japanese maples take a while. Give it super thrive this spring (rooting hormone) and keep it watered.  10 years from now it'll be fine.

gardening,I battle with the squirrels over the bird feeder and my tomatoes in my garden. So i trap them and drive them out about 10 miles away and release them in the woods.

gardening,Good tips. Thanks!
gardening,That makes sense. I think it has to be a drainage issue rather than filling to much to great a bogging issue. It has only been 'rain filled' or the soil watered directly for a couple of years because I couldn't get it to dry out. I didn't want to add more to the reservoir. I hope that makes sense.

gardening,6a gardener here. We got 10‚Äù last weekend and flurries yesterday. I usually wait until may for tomatoes. I‚Äôve lost too many to late frosts
gardening,"Oh - one other thing. I always put a layer of mulch on top of the soil, like 2-3"". It's so cheap and makes it look nice. But it also helps keep the soil temperature more even and keeps the soil more evenly moist.

I like to think it has helped.... I guess I should have reapplied some in the fall over my daffodil patch, though, cause the smallest ones definitely popped up during our warm spell in February and then died..... sigh."
gardening,I had this moment but it was flower blossoms when the wind picked up. I was baffled for a minute before I realized it wasn't snow in April.
gardening,"Yikes, that's pretty wild. 

Ok my totally non-expert suggestion would be. Pop the pot off. My guess is the soil ball will be a 100% compacted mass of root. Take a big knife and slice the soil ball into half or quarters, like a pie. Repot the 2 or 4 chunks in larger pots. Wait a week, a good number of the plants will probably die. At this point trim out such that you have one plant left in each pot. I can't guarantee that *any* of them would survive this procedure, since I have no idea how tangled up the roots all are. 

If you just want a guaranteed *something* and don't want as much risk, then just right now cut all the stems except 1 off at the soil, and replant into a larger pot."
gardening,I love the contrast of colors so much!
gardening,"Some ‚Äúself watering‚Äù units aren‚Äôt designed with proper watering amount and frequency in mind. This unit relies on capillary wicking and will not adjust or provide a metered amount according to plant need but will instead allow water to ‚Äúbog‚Äù the soil as long as the soil has an ounce of open space to ‚Äúwick‚Äù water into.

You can still use it but I‚Äôd give ample break before filling the supply reservoir (according to plant water needs) or plant ‚Äúbog‚Äù loving plants!"

gardening,Thanks pumpkins are the only plant I try and grow every year. One year I had so many I was giving them away to people on the street. My wifes class gets the mini pumpkins I grow. Sadly my seeds got ruined over winter so I need to buy them this season.
gardening,they dead. sorry
gardening,Whoa! Cool. I think I'll buy some adults when my plants are inevitably overrun by aphids soon
gardening,"I have no experience with any particular variety, but I can tell you a bit about this type of nut tree because they grow wild all over the PNW.  Hazel/filbert/cobnut trees are understory trees (really a big multi trunked shrub) that will grow in thick shade but will be healthier and more productive in part sun.  If you only have one, you won't be eating nuts because squirrels will not leave them alone. They'll strip the green nuts, they'll pilfer every last ripe nut. If you want nuts, you'll need enough trees to share."
gardening,Sunflowers are so rewarding to grow from seed! So quick to sprout and grow
gardening,I'm going to shitty water color this. It's beautiful.
gardening,"I set up an LED room this year and it got overrun by aphids. I decided on adult ladybirds as a pest control, due to price, compared to other possibilities. They immediately got to having loads of sex and laid squillions of eggs. Those eggs hatched into squillions of larvae that hoovered up everything and now they‚Äôre pupating."
gardening,Good luck on the giant pumpkins. That's a bucket list plant for me too. Especially now that I live somewhere that gets trick or treaters.
gardening,"Awesome, good to know. I don't have any babies or diapers, but I do have a couple of 'watering mats' with them in, lol. I might cut them up and put a couple pieces in each of my fabric bags. Thanks!"
gardening,Thanks. It was shocking. I thought it was a spider nest... I am terrified of spiders. So I almost got rid of it. Until I googled it. Now I'm just waiting

gardening,"Research chlorosis, you could possibly be a little too attentive to the shrub creating issues for it"
gardening,I used to keep my pumpkins in the back. I wanted another bed and room for more containers so pumpkins get moved out front. I figured I'd grow the big ones in the hopes they won't get stolen. That and I don't want to move 100 pound pumpkins.

gardening,It came in a surprise pack. Got a few of them x)
gardening,"Thank you for your reply and I'm sure you're right with the not needing to uproot the grass but the grass area is far lower than the path and the greenhouse at the back, so we were going to put top soil down to make it all level and either put turf or seed down."
gardening,I had no idea this was a thing. Down the Internet rabbit hole I go!
gardening,"I think I may have to do that. Any drainage no matter how minimal, clearly isn't working as it should!"
gardening,"I know the feeling. We ran out of space in the back so all i could do was try to fit some watermelons in the front yard beds. Between the squirrels and mischievous neighborhood kids I figured if they grew they get taken or damaged. They didn't but that's probably because they didn't have time to get very big. Typical bad planning. Buy all the seeds, try to figure out the rest later...."
gardening,"Overall that plant looks great and is on track to give you some great results.

The purple bumpy leaf shows that the plant had some kind of stress it didn't like earlier, but the perfect new growth indicates that things have been completely good for a while. If I had to guess it's probably edema and the plant was significantly overwatered at some point.

Those lower leaves are going to get pruned anyway when it goes in the garden / final container, so no big deal."
gardening,A tube at the top that adds water to a tray in the bottom of the planter. There are wicking straps at the bottom of the planter which feed the water up to the soil.

gardening,"Generally, I don't think you need to totally start the grass over. Think about it this way, any grass that survived this long is probably tough and deep rooted.

For the weeds, you want a selective weed control that lets you seed in 1 to 2 weeks. Quinclorac 75 DF would work well for established crab grass and you can seed in a week."
gardening,I'm no expert but I've read that you can push a spade down a couple feet away from the trunk in 4 directions to clip old roots and it'll stimulate new growth. I've never done it but maybe something you can look into.
gardening,"Well too close was my first thought too.  I put up several 200 feet apart and even then 1 pair has tried to take both boxes though I have a feeling I know which one they'll eventually settle on.  Next year I plan on moving the second even further away.

In my experience the tree sparrows only get the boxes if you put them up too late.  Earlier is better for getting the bluebirds but think about trying just one box.

They also probably haven't built nests yet even if they are planning on it.  Here (upstate NY) they claim the box in March but don't build a nest until May"

I know in the hot summer months, it's important to water earlier in the morning (or later in the eve) to minimize water evaporation. I am curious at what temperature this starts to be an issue.

gardening,"As long as it doesn't go below say 30 or even 28-29 for too long everything is fine. Peonies laugh at snow. The magnolias are touch and go every year, they often get frostbit (25 degrees will do it I think) and turn brown."
gardening,Good God pot shopping annoys me but yes I think you're right!
gardening,Could try digging it up or just keep mowing it/cutting it back. Sheet mulching might work.
gardening,looks wow
gardening,"Alternatives:

1. You can also take the plants outside every day to get about 6 hours of sun (after you harden them off gradually if you haven't already) and keep them going that way. I've done this and while it will stress the plants some they can survive this way. It's also a pain moving them out and in every day.
2. Walls of water are an alternative also. Unfortunately they're fairly expensive so it probably depends upon how many plants you have and your budget. These act like little greenhouses and the water will keep the internals from freezing down to about 25-26 degrees. I use these and would have had my first round of tomatoes out under these already except for 6 inches of snow and cold temps all week long.

What you're proposing will be fine as long as it doesn't dip below freezing. The toms may show some stress from low overnight temps. Slow growth, possibly leaf purpling, but it will be better than not having your plants getting properly lit. If you wrap tomato cages and it does get below freezing you can cover the open tops and get a few degrees of protection."
gardening,I got excited by a couple of 60 degree days and decided to put my seedlings outside. Forgot them 2 nights ago and they froze. 5b woes.
gardening,"The overall success rate that rooting hormone gives you is pretty slight, but there are tons of plants in the world and those that are naturally harder to root will benefit more.

For roses though, I'd suggest using it.  Roses root pretty darn well actually, but the moist conditions needed to root them also favors fungus.   Roses have kind of more fungal problems than other plants, so you are racing to get enough roots so you can move them to drier conditions before the fungus does them in.  So any little thing like root hormone can help in that case."

gardening,What I might do is figure out times in the summer where you don't have fruit for a few weeks and try to pick something that you think you would enjoy that harvests during that time. Perhaps something between your Methley and Elberta?
gardening,"Oh yes, they‚Äôll put out (heh) for 3-4 years! After that they‚Äôll still have foliage but may not produce as prolifically. Also, they‚Äôll put out little runners (baby plants). Once those have roots, separate them from the mother plant by snipping the vine/umbilical cord and then potting them up too. Free plants!

For the most part, I would say they‚Äôll be fine over winter... with the caveat that since yours are in a container, you‚Äôd want to bring them inside when the temps are below freezing. When they‚Äôre planted in the ground, they‚Äôre much more resilient. When we had the deep freeze in Texas back in Feb, my plants were exposed for 5 days when it wasn‚Äôt higher than 27 degrees at any time and they were just fine."

gardening,\*punches OP in the face\*
gardening,"Thanks for the advice!

Yeah, I'm excited to share the experience with her. Obviously its more time to have her help out, but the time enjoying the outside with her is priceless.

She actually started out by picking leaves off my shrubs and I redirected her. She enjoys picking at things and handing them to me. When inside, its the dog hair!"
gardening,"I think people use them for decoration for sweets, (dip them in a sugar glaze and put on a cake), but there are other things you can do with them. The flowed doesn‚Äôt have much of a taste but the greens might be edible too. There is also a little science experiment you can do with them since they are ph sensitive."
gardening,"I started them from seed about 4 weeks ago and potted up about one week ago. I think generally they're looking pretty healthy but a few of them have a weird purple/bumpy leaf or two. I've inspected them very carefully and can't find any sort of insect on them. I think I'm doing a decent job of watering them enough but not too often. The seed starting mix they're in feeds them for ""up to 3 months"" and I just put them in fresh mix when I potted up last week. They're under grow lights approx 14-16 hours a day"
gardening,Phoenix?  I had no idea they did so well here until I took a different side street than normal and a house had a straight up hollyhock jungle.  What do they look like in summer?
gardening,You have to ask the employees or just look around and know what you are looking at.
gardening,Darn okay. My fault completely. All the other plants are fine.
gardening,Thank you!
gardening,Don't be surprised if it doesn't make it.
gardening,Thank you
gardening,Un even ground and there could be pesticides or other chemicals I don‚Äôt want in my food. Better for your back.
gardening,Love living in New England
gardening,"Oh my, that is crazy."
gardening,"Here on Long Island it‚Äôs the same,freezing in the early morning sunny and warm mid morning so I take everything out of my closed in porch to get some real sun and by 4:00 it‚Äôs grey cold and windy again! Every day! Mother‚Äôs Day really is the turning point in NY your right!"
gardening,"Where in 6a? That's my zone too. I can say never plant in April. Some people swear by Mother's Day here in Ohio, but I always do the first week of May, no issues yet, knock on wood. I always check the forecast in depth before deciding when."
gardening,"In any online hobby group you get folks that are really passionate. Sometimes I feel that passion is hyper focused. 

Yes, I've used them. Yes, I feel they're safe to use. 

If you have a baby you can steal them from a clean diaper lol.

Don't go overboard with adding them. Water them first before mixing to see how your mix is going. The idea is that the roots are going to reach right into them to find moisture reserves."
gardening,Viola sp. (violets)
gardening,"Eek, put mine on a windowsill in the sun. Bad idea?"
gardening,"I feel like it really depends on the person. Personally, I hate getting houseplants cause I have shit lighting in my house and always kill them. However, I'd be thrilled to get a native perennial for the garden. Even then you might wanna just ask what they like, some people (me) are kinda particular about what they plant."
gardening,howdy from deerfield as well! ive been jealously eyeing everyones amazing magnolias :)
gardening,"You get to decide how big your plants will get. If you want them to stay in this pot, then prune them regularly to size. 

I prefer glazed pots like this because it looks nicer and can feel more pulled together in your home. Some people prefer the wild look and grow in traditional unglazed terra cotta and let their plants just keep growing as big as they want. Both are good options, it‚Äôs entirely up to you."
gardening,It‚Äôs amazing but probably inedible.
gardening,I feel this; selling my house and I'm currently garden-less.
gardening,I love this ‚ù§üß°üíõüíöüíô
gardening,Congrats! Is it hard to remove? What type of covering is that?
gardening,"I read that COVID lockdowns meant a lot less pollution last year, so more UV light got through, so the plants are just going wild. Pollen levels are insane this spring."
gardening,üòÇüòÇüòÇ
gardening,"south-central Texas - same. We had a cold front come through yesterday, and it dropped to 67F. My rain barrels were completely dry until we got a 1/4"" of rain last week. We could use more."
gardening,So pretty! üå∏
gardening,This is beautiful! But wait....YOU HAVE A PEONY FIELD?! A FIELD!
gardening,"Oooh, violets :O Okay, thank you :)"
gardening,That will help. I'd put down a lil cardboard on top of the weeds first though.
gardening,This is accurate.
gardening,"I would plan on second week in May but keep an eye on the forecasts. I follow a couple meteorologists in my area that often put our garden based forecasts around that time, can be very helpful. If you go on the earlier side just be prepared with a plan to cover up in case of emergency. I usually wait until 1 week past average frost, but have gone sooner."
gardening,How does a graph work with Tomatoes though? A graph is on paper....
gardening,"Your secret is safe with me. Nothing worse than the smug look on their face that says ""I told you so."""
gardening,Exciting that I can eat them! I had recently heard you can eat glechoma hederacea and part of my posting this was so I could get a name and look into if I could eat this too xD
gardening,"Roots grow from
The root apical meristem from the root tips. If there is no meristem, there is no root."
gardening,My man's in the future with his Beefsteak Kush
gardening,Thought this was r/cinemagraphs
gardening,Aren‚Äôt dogwoods the most beautiful sight?
gardening,"Ooooh, I see! Violets! Okay then."
gardening,[deleted]
gardening,"I feel this. Also, it made me feel like a dummy. I order plants from Breck's and I was annoyed that they delayed shipping them to me until early May. Not annoyed enough to complain to anyone but my husband. Then I read the note with my order that said they send plants at the optimal time to get them in the ground. Looking at all the snow we got the past few days, they were right and I was wrong (like usual, but don't tell my husband I said that)"
gardening,Looks like violets. My whole back yard is covered in them. You can eat them!
gardening,"I kinda doubt it. It's in the cashew family so maybe another member of the same family (mango, cashew, etc.) or a more desirable sumac like lemonade berry (rhus integrifolia). Also, the sumac fruits themselves are edible!"
gardening,Wild Violet
gardening,Wow
gardening,Anybody? :(
gardening,That's nice of you.
gardening,Very nice! I went with painted red rocks in the strawberry patch and that worked for a few weeks till they learned
gardening,Thanks! I am happy I managed to get some.
gardening,"I had been thinking it was glechoma hederacea (ground ivy) but I recently noticed how different it really looks from the pictures of glechoma hederacea I can google up. Still, quite similar. Maybe this is something related?"
gardening,"Problem with San Diego is that the weather is so nice and consistent that when it drops 5 degrees F, you literally freeze to death. San Diego is slowly turning you into a lizard."
gardening,Deerfield is a beautiful little corner of MA.  Miss that area so much.
gardening,"I had this problem last year as well! At each node where the leaf meets the stem there are dormant buds that will ‚Äúwake up‚Äù once the stem has been topped off higher up, and I think you might have enough leaf growth to get it to bloom. I would leave these outside and water them normally but try to put some netting/fencing around them. Good luck!"
gardening,"&gt;C.S.U.'s wrong and you're right Texas A.&amp;M.'s wrong and you're right L.S.U.'s wrong and you're right O.S.U's wrong and you're right I.S.U.'s wrong and you're right N.S.U.'s wrong and you're right Cornell's wrong and you're right Penn state wrong

Show me where they say that herbicides aren't pesticides. Just one. Show me where one of them say that herbicides aren't pesticides"
gardening,"It could be a witches broom mutation. On cherry trees, these are usually caused by insect or animal damage to the tree and a fungal infection called Taphrina

As a horticulturist, I'm quite keen on them as you can sometimes get really interesting mutations that are worth propagating.  However, I can't tell from the photo of this a broom mutation"
gardening,My instinct is that the unflowering branch was grafted onto this tree at some point in its life.
gardening,Lol. Yes. Also my favorite brand.
gardening,I successfully rooted rose cuttings without root hormone for transplanting. Cutting them early in the spring when they are full of vigor and vim seems to work well.
gardening,"Just found one of my wooden bird feeders laying on the ground broken today. I filled them all yesterday, lol. Walking through, I found a nice sprout in the garden bed, all by itself. 

Two weeks ago, my hubby built a flower bed that I exclusively planted at least fourteen different types of sunflowers in.. No sprouts yet.. I hope the little buggers and birbs didn't have a buffet on them. :("
gardening,We're in zone 4b and usually plant outdoors around Memorial Day.
gardening,OP had a stroke?
gardening,"I know this is a gardening group but I'm still in shock by how many backyard beekeeper hives are stollen every year.  I have 2 hives in my garden, I can't imaginen a theif walking through my backyard to get 2 super heavy mad stinging boxes but it's becoming more and more common."
gardening,"awww I'm jealous, looks so cute!!"
gardening,Came here to say this. Tomatoes have very similar needs to cannabis. You can even graft them onto one another root stocks if you're feeling creative.
gardening,Maybe drill holes in the bottom if you can and make it a normal planter?
gardening,"Seriously- gardening (in whatever form) with kids is such a beautiful shared experience. My kids are teens now and couldn‚Äôt care less, but they (and I) have a lot of good memories of when they‚Äôd lug leaf mold to mom in the garden, or find the cucumbers that stayed hidden...
Treasure these little, seemingly innocuous moments- they build into happy memories ‚ù§Ô∏è"
gardening,"Pretty! Where I live, they say spring won't come until it snows on the dogwood blooms."
gardening,I have used it successfully on weed clones and also rose clippings. Tried it on redbud tree clippings with no success :(
gardening,Indeed it is
gardening,Tomatoes are pretty similar once they start to grow up. You can also train them and feed very similarly.
gardening,"The main benefit of having no winter, I would imagine, would be the part where *winter doesn't happen* 

I'm not jealous or anything, I'm just going to be over here pining for heat .\_\_\_\_\_."
gardening,I had bamboo in my yard in Washington state
gardening,"I'm agreeing with You, you are right and everyone else on the planet is wrong thank you for enlightening us your Wondrousness"
gardening,"There's a rather big difference between a homeowner putting down weed killer every few years on a small, &lt;.5 acre property, and a massive commerical agribusiness dousing their entire Farm every year. 
Anyways, this stuff is working great on the creeping violet &amp; star of Bethlehem, so I completely recommend it for addressing common lawn weeds."
gardening,[deleted]
gardening,"Thank you. I can‚Äôt ever remember them flowering and they must have been here for like 15+ years. They do look like peonies, I must admit. I suppose we will see this summer!"
gardening,"My squash have something like that, on the outer edge of the leaves only though. They have not gone outside yet either. Unfortunately, my post never gained any traction on here when I tried to find an answer but hopefully your post will."
gardening,"You carefully separate them and bury them up to the leaves.  You can use the same solo cups or pots or whatever they are.  But I would wait till they have true leaves coming out first.  Tomatoes root all along the stem, so burying them deep gives you more roots.  It would be nice to give them more light too.  You might think about grow lights."
gardening,"My pea plants are starting to flower now. Have them in a milk carton in my window. Got some good sun lately here so they are loving life. Hoping to get some peas from it, but it's mostly for fun."
gardening,LmaoüòÖüòÖ
gardening,"If you are raising from seed in the house, be sure to harden them off before planting.  Slugs are a biggee and you can get slug pellets.   As for the other vermin, not a big problem with flowers.  Cats will dig and poop, so you can spray on orange oil, on the soil, not the plants.  Foxes are great, encourage them.  I use fox urine for my veggies to keep the squirrels and chipmunks away.   Birds are good as they eat bugs."
gardening,"Our tree seems to have a bit at the top that doesn't blossom, the branches are denser but otherwise it looks healthy. We were thinking about cutting that bit off as it appears to be a side branch but it is thicker than the true top."
gardening,It's a pimple squish it... No I joke your monstera is acting as normal!
gardening,"I use it, but I have it in several strengths which are used on different types of plants. I also start all my cuttings in sand as opposed to soil. I use hormex brand"
gardening,"Thats good, thanks for letting me know. :)"
gardening,"Ah, thanks for your response. He picked it because he knows I like to press little wildflowers. Never pressed anything as big as a tulip but I guess I'll try if it cant regrow."
gardening,"I would not use mercury because it's a heavy metal and fairly dangerous. You may want to see about contacting a plumber who might be able to send an auger or snake through the pipe.

I'm not sure which subreddit would be best to ask this question... maybe /r/Plumbing ?"
gardening,I just want to take off work and sit in your backyard!
gardening,"Its great for soil building if all the parts have been put in, but can take years to be true soil where there most possible nutrients and minerals are available"
gardening,Beautiful!
gardening,"My immediate first thought is ""where are you that putting mercury into your water supply is a go to plan?"" 

Second thought is the common way I would see where I'm at to do this. Stick a hose connected to a pressure washer to the bottom of the well, run it until mud stops coming out of the top. Another option is to suck the mud out with some kind of sludge or slurry pump."
gardening,"Some self water planters dont have drainage, or the drainage they have is more like an over flow drain on a bath tub. Rocks and sand can help with drainage but idk how the will work in your planter. Good luck"
gardening,"&gt;  C.S.U.'s wrong and you're right Texas A.&amp;M.'s wrong and you're right L.S.U.'s wrong and you're right O.S.U's wrong and you're right I.S.U.'s wrong and you're right N.S.U.'s wrong and you're right Cornell's wrong and you're right Penn state wrong

Tripling down now. Impressive."
gardening,"That happens half the time here too, but this year has been glorious here, never got nippy or too windy."
gardening,If you are trying to harden off the seedlings. I recommend cloudy weather for the first time you take them outside. And only an hour at first. You need to acclimatize the seedlings to the outside environment and from the effects of the sun.
gardening,Can‚Äôt wait for mine to get that tall üò≥
gardening,Yep I would say repot them as soon as possible

gardening,"https://www.mda.state.mn.us/pesticide-fertilizer/pesticide-overview

&gt;Pesticides may be either chemical substances or biological agents, and have a broad range of uses. Pesticides are often used to control weeds (**herbicides**), insects (insecticides), and plant diseases (fungicides). Other pesticides registered for use in Minnesota are chemicals not commonly thought of as pest control agents, such as bleach and antimicrobial household sprays used to sanitize surfaces. 

https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/pesticide

&gt;
A pesticide is defined as a chemical agent used to destroy or control pests. The root word is the Latin word ‚Äúcida‚Äù which means to kill. The generic term ‚Äúpesticides‚Äù can apply to a wide spectrum of chemicals, including insecticides, rodenticides, **herbicides**, fungicides, biocides, and similar chemicals.

&gt;Pesticides can be grouped according to the types of pests which they kill:

&gt;Insecticides - insects

&gt;**Herbicides** - plants

&gt;Rodenticides - rodents (rats and mice)

&gt;Bactericides - bacteria

&gt;Fungicides - fungi

&gt;Larvicides - larvae"

gardening,Squirrels: CHALLENGE ACCEPTED
gardening,What about spinach? I have some of those little ones coming up too.
gardening,Temperatures weren‚Äôt freezing but there was some frost on the leaves. My other zucchini plant that were out that night aren‚Äôt as droopy. This one is the biggest one I have. This is my first time growing from seed.
gardening,"This is so beautiful, congratulations on your personal paradise ü§ó"
gardening,"We have April Snow in SC too, it‚Äôs called pollen bloom. Literal clouds of pollen coming off pine trees and making pollen drifts on the ground."
gardening,"Thanks for the advice! Most of the peppers ( bell or a variety of spicy ones ) only have one set of true leaves so far, but look healthy otherwise. I'm hoping I'll still get some vegetables out of them. I'm contemplating adding fertilizer to boost their leaf bloomage."
gardening,Lovely
gardening,"Where do you think I got the idea? :P 

I fed those little tree rats all winter as they chased off the local birds and even broke 2 feeders! I had a few sunflowers sprout randomly next to the house during that last warm spell and it got me thinking lol."
gardening,"https://www.britannica.com/technology/pesticide

&gt;Pesticide, any toxic substance used to kill animals, fungi, or **plants** that cause economic damage to crop or ornamental plants or are hazardous to the health of domestic animals or humans. All pesticides interfere with normal metabolic processes in the pest organism and often are classified according to the type of organism they are intended to control. (See **herbicide**; insecticide; fungicide; fumigant.)

http://npic.orst.edu/ingred/products.html

&gt;A pesticide is any substance ""intended for preventing, destroying, repelling, or mitigating any pest."" Many people are surprised to learn that antimicrobials, **herbicides**, and bug repellents are all types of pesticides. Plant growth regulators, defoliants, desiccants, and nitrogen stabilizers are also pesticides.

https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/agents/pesticides/index.cfm

&gt;A pesticide is any substance used to kill, repel, or control certain forms of plant or animal life that are considered to be pests. Pesticides include **herbicides** for destroying weeds and other unwanted vegetation, insecticides for controlling a wide variety of insects, fungicides used to prevent the growth of molds and mildew, disinfectants for preventing the spread of bacteria, and compounds used to control mice and rats."
gardening,Beautiful
gardening,i love these. saw plenty in the tetons as well as fireweed and lupines. did you grow this?
gardening,"looking a little, uh.. crispy. i think i should have gotten planted a while ago."
gardening,Good for bird feeder
gardening,That‚Äôs definitely Japanese knotweed ...
gardening,I will have to do more research!
gardening,That is precious!
gardening,"Mine is new too! I'm really happy with it so far, easy to assemble and it'll help with our out of control rabbit issue. We have a few herbs and some brussels going in there right now. Can't wait for these random frosts to end so we can get moving on the fun stuff!"

gardening,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesticide

&gt;Pesticides are substances that are meant to control pests.[1] The term pesticide includes all of the following: **herbicide**, insecticides (which may include insect growth regulators, termiticides, etc.) nematicide, molluscicide, piscicide, avicide, rodenticide, bactericide, insect repellent, animal repellent, antimicrobial, and fungicide.[2] The most common of these are herbicides which account for approximately 80% of all pesticide use

https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/farm-practices-management/fertilizers-pesticides/

&gt;U.S. crop producers use a variety of practices to reduce yield losses to pests. They may choose crop choices, planting date adjustments, and crop rotations to limit the emergence and spread of weeds, insects, and funguses. They may use mechanical methods, such as tillage and hoeing by hand, to manage weeds. Some may release beneficial organisms in fields, especially when managing insect pests. They may also apply chemical pesticides, including **herbicides**, insecticides, and fungicides, usually through spraying the fields.

&gt;Plant protection products are pesticides that are mainly used to keep crops healthy and prevent them from being destroyed by disease and infestation. They include **herbicides**, fungicides, insecticides, acaricides, plant growth regulators and repellents."
gardening,"No it can't but it will regrow next year from the bulb if all the foliage isn't missing. I'm sure they will forgive him. 
I actually let young people come into my yard and cut flowers tulips and daffodils for their parents they come in and pick a couple on their happy and on their way"
gardening,"Haha, sorry, I want either, I just get annoyed when people insist it isn't x without giving any reason or saying what they think it is. Tbh it does look a bit like sweetgum. Hard to say without seeing leaf arrangement, knowing where op is, surrounding plants, etc."
gardening,Take another pic when the bins are put away for the full effect
gardening,"Sorry, it‚Äôs not.  The flower is a temporary part of any plant, but fortunately the plant is fine without it.  It will regrow another flower next year, so long as the squirrels don‚Äôt eat the bulb."
gardening,No need for that when there's a few bird feeders  in the yard and you watch the squirrels bury the seeds. I have tiny sunflower sprouts all over the yard. Too bad they'll be chopped when grass is mowed.
gardening,I love desert plants. After the big storms in El Paso the mountains overlooking Ft. Bliss would turn purple from the blooming desert flowers. Wish I had pictures.
gardening,"I like it too! I love floral dresses. I'm all about that mid 90s ""alternative"" look, even though I've always been fashion-illiterate. Living in a cottage is my dream, haha, along with a touch of mid-century decor, food forests, greenhouses, gardens of all kinds everywhere and I'd be in heaven."
gardening,Noice. Good luck with your gardening m8
gardening,"Yes, I know, it's cool. I planted basil once with ~35 degrees Celsius and it sprouted the next day."
gardening,"This happened to my mature Apple Tree last year, I think it‚Äôs powdery mildew. Eventually the leaves turned brown and died before the end of the summer. I read spraying it with milk can help but I‚Äôm not sure it actually did much for mine. One of the causes as I understand it is letting the plant get too damp or not having good air circulation around it."
gardening,big tough guy lol
gardening,"Oh I didn't even realize that it will last more than one season!
Can I just leave it outside during winter on my balcony and it will do its thing once it's spring?"
gardening,"They can handle freezes ok, I usually cover them if a freeze is coming. We've had a few freezes just this week and my radishes are looking good. Good luck!"
gardening,Beautiful. Enjoy your hard work.
gardening,Too much water. Are there drainage holes in the bottom? There should be.
gardening,"Well we have tons of shade, it's just dry shade. So I guess we are half way there! Thanks for the recommendations :)"
gardening,I just got the same raised bed! Do you like it?
gardening,"Oh no, I fit into a stereotype for once. I've never heard of this."
gardening,Some sort of fungus or spider mites.
gardening,Thanks everyone! I guess I'll know for sure when it fruits üòä
gardening,"This is off topic, but.....

I used to wear those gloves for work. Had to have them on all day pretty much. I started to get a rash on my hands, thought it was dry skin, so I‚Äôd pile on the lotion, then put on gloves. That didn‚Äôt help, and it was getting worse. 

Turns out, you can be allergic to nitrile. So now, I have to go out of the way to get latex gloves. My one point to allllll of this is: 

Latex keeps out more capsaicin than nitrile does. Sorry for the ramble, but your gloves brought it all back :)"
gardening,"Beautiful, but our freeze in Michigan killed my Magnolia blooms just as they were getting going.  Wahhhhhh."
gardening,I put some peas in the ground like a week and a half ago and they sprouted in literally 3 days
gardening,"I live in Texas, and when the heat hits hard in the summer, i let one of the stronger suckers grow, and cut the main stem all the way back.  By the time it starts to cool, that sucker is it's own main stalk and fruit starts producing.  It was fruiting right up until the frost hit.  I think in a warmer climate, I could have kept those bad boys going strong for a long time."
gardening,"Gives an idea. I wouldn't have had to cover my beans from snow if I'd waited until the lilacs went to full bloom.

On the other hand, pretty sure blueberry bushes and strawberries will always need to be covered in a sudden frost"
gardening,"It almost looks like powdery mildew to me. But it seems a little early in the year for it. If it is, though, you'll need a fungicide spray."
gardening,Good luck with your plants üå±! Still jealous :)
gardening,:(!! All my landlord does is send incompetent contractors who spray driveway tar all over my yard and dig up some of my plants to lay pvc pipes.
gardening,I‚Äôm in Hatfield and the forsythia in this area are crazy this year!
gardening,Not at all i dont know which climate you have but here avocados grow vigorously and this one already has thick trunk so i didnt support it
gardening,"That's awesome they came back!  Especially since you overwintered in 7b. One last question, did you soak the tuber before planting? I've seen lots of ""tuber prep"" advice and my experience ends at dahlia tubers, which essentially require only being planted in the ground."
gardening,How was this shot? It's beautiful
gardening,"Hi neighbor, I‚Äôm in Hatfield! Wasn‚Äôt yesterday the weirdest!?"
gardening,"My lucky bamboo is getting little black spots on the stalk and I'm not sure what it is (close up doesn't look like insects, but I wouldn't rule out a fungus). The stalks are also dried out at the tops but still grow leaves. The plant lives on my desk, doesn't get direct sunlight, and sits in water (mostly tap but I just learned about the issue with that) I change the water every week or so. My wife wants me to cut off anything that isn't green but I don't want to do too much."
gardening,The US is the same but with more fires so we have 15-16 seasons.
gardening,Yea I‚Äôm in Florida where its either beaming you with sun rays or it‚Äôs raining so hard you can‚Äôt leave the house so it‚Äôs makes things easy to grow
gardening,"I have a large gardening plot in my backyard that is always overrun with weeds. It's a full time job just keeping them under control. I want to start planting stuff there but I'm new to gardening and am taking it a few at a time (so adding stuff year to year). In the meantime is it ok to just order some bulk wood chips and cover the entire area with them, including surrounding existing plants to protect them? Is this best practice or is there a better way to handle this?"
gardening,I know because I'm so excited about my garden I overwatered my kale and all the bottom leaves turned yellow I stopped and a week later it's poppin!
gardening,"I'm attempting zinnias from seed for the first time, and someone told me they just scatter the seeds before a rain - which seems brilliant. It's supposed to rain tomorrow, but will probably be a decent washout - would you till and scatter pre-rain still? Or would you wait and scatter after the rain when the ground is soft? (If it matters, I'm in 7b, and we have the red clay soil, hence the tilling)

Thanks in advance!"
gardening,thanks friend:)
gardening,"I will be container gardening in fabric pots/grow bags for the first time this year. Our summers can get quite hot, and all the research I've done indicates the main problem in having tomatoes, etc grow in them is that they don't hold moisture as well. I'll be mixing in coir, vermiculite, etc to try to balance the moisture issue. Wanted to know, if anyone here has used the hydrogel granules like 'soil moist' for food plants? Do they work? Is it safe? I'm seeing conflicting info online."
gardening,yes and same
gardening,Thanks that‚Äôs really useful to know. I‚Äôll find a good spot indoors.
gardening,"I'm growing also myself in zone 9, lol. The sun makes miracles for my energy and inspiration, people are nice, friendly, happy, following slow life. I don't need to wear tons of annoying clothes. I do love zones 9-10. Not only because of gardening. It's a real paradise."
gardening,Is it snowing there too?
gardening,Do you have more info on this?  Are you saying plastic marked specifically with the recycling logo with the number 1 in the center?
gardening,"Ground up coconut husk
Plants were purchased from another greenhouse, they have been chilled in a freezer for a certain amount of time"
gardening,Yeah should be fine. I put my jiffy pods in a closed dresser drawer until they pop. Once they‚Äôre almost touching the lid then they get light
gardening,My pleasure!
gardening,I meant to say the third photo! Any help is much appreciated.
gardening,Okay thank you. The soil temperature is around 28c and weather is 17c. I‚Äôll keep them inside in a shady warm spot then?
gardening,"1500 strawberry, and way more lettuce"
gardening,"If you put that in direct sun the temperature will jump super high and everything inside will cook.

You want calm, warm and dark if nothing has sprouted yet."
gardening,"Nope , we have lights over the lettuce for dark days"
gardening,Yes it has been leaking all dow. The side and attracting ants. Friends bees. Split her hive. Waiting on new queen and box hive.

gardening,"I just ordered some seeds from Amazon.  It was about 6$ for ""20"" seeds - but there were actually about 50-60 seeds in the bag. 

I did seeds because it's still a bit early to take cuttings from a well-established plant I already have, but we just put up some fencing and I want to get it covered as soon as possible so I didn't want to have to wait to make cuttings. 

You can get the little pods of dirt at most bigger department stores (Walmart has then if you're in the US).   You just moisten them until they're all soggy.  Then place your seeds on top and cover lightly with soil.  Keep it inside by a window and mist them twice a day."

gardening,"They may make it, but will definitely be behind the ball.  Last year, rabbits and deer completely deleafed a couple hibiscus plants I had.  I vowed to save them, and by the end of summer, they were full of leaves again and I had some blooms.  

More importantly, you need to plan on protecting them from the next attack.  Makeshift chicken wire (or welded wire) cylinders almost become invisible from a distance once their brand new sheen wears off, so that could be an option."

gardening,"&gt; I don't know exactly how big my plants will get 

It's possible to look up ""mature size"" on the Internet. What are you growing?

An expensive terracotta pot isn't going to work any better than a cheap terracotta pot. Clay is clay, no matter who made it, or how, or how it's painted or glazed. 

A lot of this is advertising puffery:

&gt;The clay is of high quality, this pot will last the test of time,


What damages clay pots, other than dropping them, is the freezing and thawing of winters. Water molecules inevitably trapped within the porous clay expand with freezing and crack the pot.

So an expensive clay pot isn't necessarily going to be any better at withstanding a severe winter than a cheap one would.

&gt;The high density of the clay makes the pots frost resistant.

Note that they don't specify ""frost proof"" or ""will not crack"".  That's because they can't guarantee that. It's advertising puffery, no more.

If you want pots that you can leave outside all winter long, you're looking at something like a large wooden or concrete planter, not individual pots made of clay or plastic.  

Also, in severe winter areas, you can't leave container plants outdoors anyway, since once the root ball freezes, the wind then sublimates moisture from them, dehydrating and killing the plant.

So plants that need a winter chill period for bloom are protected for the winter in one of two ways. Either you sink the pot in the ground in a sheltered area up to the rim, and then mulch over it with a foot of loose straw.

Or you place the entire pot, once the plant has gone dormant, inside an unheated garage or shed for the duration."
gardening,Air root it will keep growing to help support the plant structurally . Direct it into the dirt or cut it off.
gardening,Most horrible smell on the planet is their musk
gardening,It‚Äôs an aerial root.

First rule of long life and happiness is you can ignore any ""Study"" done by a moron that thinks herbicides and pesticides are the same thing, and say's ""Herbicides are the most widely applied type of pesticides"" 

You know what's worse than ignorance? Arrogant ignorance. 

Pesticide is the broad category for things used to control pests. Insects are pests, and they're controlled with insecticides. Fungus are pests and they're controlled with fungicides. 

So what do you use to control pests that are weeds or plants?

You use herbicides. 

Herbicides **are** pesticides. They're a type. A subset."
gardening,"&gt; Nobody moved in.

Are they too close together maybe?  I was hoping you had birds in all your boxes, because I'd like to get more than one nesting pair along our fenceline.  But I've heard they're pretty territorial and you don't want them too close to each other, or too close to other birdhouses or bird feeders."

gardening,"/r/Figs do excellent in pots but are quite thirsty, so careful in very sunny locations without drip lines or frequent watering!"
gardening,"Ants aren't usually harmful to plants and actually help keep aphids and other nuisances away if that's a problem where you are. If you have a colony of ants, something nearby is feeding them. They like sugar. Can you take away their food source?

If you want to get rid of the ants, wear gloves and repot the plant. Toss away the old pot with the ants in it. You can also use food grade Diatomaceous Earth, which is a pesticide powder but still very gentle, and sprinkle it around the bottom of the pot. You can find this in most hardware stores. Hot pepper powder like cayenne or cinnamon will make it unpleasant for them but it won't kill them.

You can pour boiling water over the colony which will kill the ants, but it will also kill the plant."

gardening,Oh ok. What do they eat if they don't have poison? ü§î
gardening,Ugh the audacity. Luckily here where I live all gardens are fenced so there‚Äôs no chance of someone casually coming in and stealing stuff (unless you‚Äôre planting on your front door which is also pretty common) BUT this doesn‚Äôt stop some people to steal flowers from CEMETERIES ??? Which has happened to me a couple of times already. Someone in the neighborhood had also planted some beautiful pansies under some small public trees in front of their house and after a couple of days there was already a sign up because someone had stolen some üò©
gardening,"Well, it's exactly like asking, ""Would you spend money on [fill in the blank with name of expensive consumer good]?""  Cars, shoes, food, hookers and blow, it's all the same type of decision.  Value for money is a highly personal benchmark that everyone draws in a different place. 

""Conspicuous consumption"" is also a factor, as always.

&gt;pretty good looking planters that are also high quality

It depends on how you're defining ""high quality"". It holds the potting soil and the plant in position the same as a plastic bucket would.  And it can be a very high quality plastic bucket, a good hard-plastic utility bucket, none of your cheap mop pails or  upcycled ice cream tubs.

&gt;But still, not really sure if it's worth spending so much money on one of those. 

""If you have to ask how much it costs, then you can't afford one.""


My specific observation in this case would be that they all break the same when you drop one.  I'd rather drop a $1.99 plain clay pot than a $60 designer pot."

gardening,"If you have sprouts pushing through, then it's not such a dense crust that sprouts can't push through. A lot depends on the composition of your soil. Since this is Year Two and you're still amassing data on your particular conditions, I'd just leave it to run, and see what happens, and then you'll know.  Seeds have been pushing through crusted soil for millions of years without any help.  The same way that a tree can send roots into a driveway or sewer line a millimeter at a time, a seedling can push through crust a millimeter at a time."

gardening,A fucking bonsai has a better ass than me. I'm out.
gardening,"The leftmost are probably salvageable, they've still got enough growth to maintain energy production for new leaves. 
I would take a wait and see approach; give them a few days of close monitoring and see if any new leaves start to form. Transplanting them now while they're vulnerable could easily cause then to shock and die."
gardening,"So ive been going to alot of nurseries and plant places and I notice the bonsais are exremelty expensive for decently sized ones. like 50 to 80 dollars. As much as id like to think big boxes like lowes feel amature, they have the biggest cheapest bonsais and I keep buying them there. They have a great selection and really nice big ones for 25 dollars. Ones i may pay a 100 for elsewhere. So I buy my bonsai at lowes, when they go on sale we get them for 10 dollars. I normally cant even buy the big bonsai dish size they give you with it for 10 or less dollars. Normally around 15 to 20 alone. I actually got a fig bonsai about twice the size with 4 times the trunk for that 25 dollar price. Our ficus bonsai's clippings weve been taking have been growing like crazy fast on clones."

gardening,"It is okay to whine.

Are they in the ground, or in containers? How long have they been in the ground, or did you overwinter them?

They go by soil temperature, not air temperature. The soil warms up independently and cumulatively, as the sun shines on it every day. So they can conceivably sprout in warm soil but then come out into freezing temps."
gardening,Zone 5 over here waving to everyone else who had snow today! Hi! üëã
gardening,"I see. The really pale ones looked deeply shocked, but with normal care and time, I don't see why they shouldn't make a full recovery.  Light, warmth, nutrients, and watering but not overwatering, plus time, are what they need.

So really, just back to basics for a while, and give them time. Don't repot them, it's a lot of stress. Just food, water, light, and let them alone.

gardening,Water splashes can do that. But bottom leaves often go a bit strange. Wait until the plant grows more leaves and first truss of fruit then you can just cut them off. Do check both sides of leaves for very small insects (mite size) and treat accordingly if you find any.

You don‚Äôt *have to* transplant plants to bigger pots. I often cut plants back to keep them a specific size. Just depends what you‚Äôre going for."

gardening,"the title of your post though... totally thought the post was going be about cannabis.

&amp;#x200B;

as far as garden pots no,, usually i just use whatever i can get my hands on, i personally try to avoid planting in pots as they need to be watered much more often vs planted in ground. sometimes i buy "" silly"" looking pots with faces on them and stuff but that's about it. and i almost always buy my flower pots at the dollar store."
gardening,"I think it depends really. I have a couple of vintage 70's pots that I am in love with. I have other pots that I feel a bit meh about. 

The pots I love I will have for decades, I hope. They are as much of a feature as the plant inside them and I would search out a plant that fits them as soon as a plant has outgrown them. Worth every penny.

Edit: If you are not absolutely in live with the pot...don't spend the extra money. Some of my favourite pots are from Ikea."
gardening,Those are seed leaves. They'll yellow and drop normally.
gardening,"All jokes aside, in Finland's north there have traditionally been 8 different seasons identified! The english translations are something like:

* The spring of crusted snow

* harvest time
* colourful autumn
* first snow
* Christmastime 

Even now, in Finnish there is a phrase for when winter comes back in spring - literally ""back-winter"" - takatalvi.

gardening,Purple ones are coming! I planted the same collection I believe. Those orange parrots get better and better and the purple lily tulips put it all over the top!
gardening,That would explain how the nut got buried in the flowerpot as well.
gardening,Nothing to be worried about I don‚Äôt think
gardening,Find SleepyLizard's video on Why Haas Seeds dont grow Haas trees
gardening,Also in bham. Had to take in my 30 plants from the balcony at 11pm when I realized what the temp was lol
gardening,"Check your local college/university's agricultural extension program--they have tons of info on growing dates for various plants for your specific area.  I used that combined with a site for days between dates to figure out when to start seeds, when to transplant them outside, and when the expected harvest will start."
gardening,I feel this hardcore. Chronic depression and anxiety for me.
gardening,"So I live in a pretty small town in Florida and some local business owner has planted pansies outside their business. Some drunk girls on their way home from a bar stole them all BUT were caught on his camera and it MADE THE PAPER and then was posted everywhere in local gardening groups. I would have died of shame if I‚Äôd made that bad of a choice and then was ALL OVER social media doing it. Also- pansies?! 

Don‚Äôt steal plants in my town, we will FIND YOU!"
gardening,Is tulip...
gardening,Seaweed/kelp mix is a great fertilizer!
gardening,Bruh summer is here
gardening,No its not bad. Most potting soil comes with slow release fertilizers in it already like i said. Thats all it is.

gardening,I like that pot!
gardening,carnation flowers
gardening,I‚Äôve read that the only way to kill it is to cut it back constantly and inject (with syringe and needle) roundup (or stronger) directly into the stem every time you do the cut back.
gardening,"Yup, I want to cry."
gardening,"First year with strawberries and so far one of my plants has two berries started and they both look normal.  The weather hasn't been cooperative since I put them in the ground but both plants have taken off pretty well with lots of new growth.  No red in the berries yet but they're still growing and I've only had them in the ground for about a week.

  I'm looking forward to the weather warming up to see how well they take off. I've been warned that strawberries produce better their second year and that I'll have to be vigilant in cutting them back because they can easily spread."
gardening,What kind of seeds?
gardening,"I am in the UK and had a conversation with my mom about thisÔºåwe‚Äôve noticed some summer flowering plants have flowered againÔºånot the usual amount but definitely a few. Also last few years we‚Äôve had geraniums that do not seem to totally stop flowering at all.

I‚Äôm wondering if the lines between seasns are blurring a little."
gardening,:( :/
gardening,Come back if you have trouble and we‚Äôll brainstorm ideas for more light if needed
gardening,"Plants with umbels for flower heads help attract parasitoid wasps (harmless little guys, not the wasps you‚Äôre used to) that lay their eggs in aphids, killing them. You can also purchase the wasps and set them free in your garden.

gardening,"If the pots too big for the plant it can hold too much moisture and rot the plant before you gets a chance to use all of the moisture and nutrients in the media. Planting it in the garden is different to a pot and it won't rot unless you over water it, but you won't be able to move it once its established and it may get 5 to 7m tall."
gardening,"I‚Äôm growing pomegranate, a lemon, and an apple tree in SoCal this year. All of them seem to be fine choices but we‚Äôll see how they turn out!"
gardening,Me after sewing seeds and then seeing my apartment complexes gardener that steps on all my plants
gardening,You get what you pay for...
gardening,Is that bad? I just water it once a week and leave it in indirect sunlight...i dont fertilise it. I only repotted it once by putting the plant w the original soil into the bigger pot of new soil.
gardening,"It might also be creeping bellflower. I had what I suspected where wild violets, but turned out to be creeping bellflower instead, which I also found invasive and unbearable. Every piece of root that is left in the ground WILL sprout a new plant. And the roots seem to break at a sneeze. Good luck. I would just convert the lawn into a pollinator garden to save the headache. I‚Äôm not much for grass anyway."
gardening,"I do not know if anyone else here has observed this at your location but here in Southern Finland, a few of us have discussed independent observation that the birch trees specifically (but other trees additionally) are not really dropping leaves, nor are the leaves changing color to the degree that we would expect by now, despite colder temperatures already.  It's almost as though they're experiencing the weather in a different manner somehow.  It's somewhat strange."
gardening,From that I guess you can just make candied juniper berries for the same effect.
gardening,"Sorry for your situation. I hope they're ok. A similar thing happened to me last year, about a dozen cucumber plants, 6 peppers, 20-30 pea plants and at least 50 cherry tomatoes all wilted and died. Our season is so short here, so a snap like that wiped out a lot of the crops I like to grow/eat for the year.

So I hope you're are going to be ok. But perhaps get some new seed sown ASAP, so you have something prepped in case the worst should happen.

Good luck."
gardening,"thanks for answering! here you have a [picture](https://imgur.com/4VUTCZt)

I dont know how many, maybe a couple of them"
gardening,"Phoenix area. Pots are bad for us in general. the clay pots dry the soil quickly. black pots are a solar over for the roots. most plants like and can handle full sun when it isn‚Äôt too hot (under 100F), trick is making sure roots are watered deeply - not just a sprinkle on the surface but that it penetrates 12-24‚Äù. with tomatoes a trick i have used to force the roots deep when planting is to pinch off all the leaves except the topmost. all the hairs will turn to roots and i plant it all the way so the new top just sticks out. unconventional but it seems to work for me. 

With the warmer summer they needed some shade. Full shade will slow kill everything, so i use a 50% shade cloth and hang it over the entire garden. no one /nothing will live exposed to 117F heat for too long. On those really hot days some extra humidity with a morning water helps too."
gardening,I would sit and watch for hours.
gardening,A bunch of crap......seriously compost is a great thing because it‚Äôs usually overlooked
gardening,Well this made my day at 2:45 in the morning. Dying.

gardening,"As a minnesotan, I laugh and relate. I hate most 'springs'. Its usu big muddy puddles and cold miserable rain. Not very bright."
gardening,Olives maybe
gardening,"Life, uh, finds a way."
gardening,Thanks!
gardening,"I lived in denver for many years and that has the unfortunate complication of being closer to the sun, being a mile high. I would just offer as much shade as they‚Äôll tolerate, probably year round. I would focus on planting things so they at least get afternoon shade, when the sun seems hottest. Water soil deeply early in the morning to prepare it for the day. 
Otherwise you might have blossom end rot on those tomatoes.

Take time to harden off seedlings and plants - even anything purchased. 

For such extreme temps I like to direct sow. I find the seedlings better prepared for the sun that way."
gardening,"As a new Gardner in phoenix, I feel for ya. I think shade and location is all we can do, you have about 10 times as many plants as I though.

Good luck."
gardening,"I'd definitely give them lots of soil. Are the pots big enough where you can just scoop the plant, roots, and surrounding soil out? Like don't shake them out and expose the roots, try to move it as a big heap then fill in the pot with the necessary soil and plop it back in. Does that make sense? Tomatoes and peppers are definitely sensitive to transplanting and shock easily, so try your best to not disturb the roots and make sure they have plenty of water (you don't want them to wilt). Strawberries and herbs don't really care so much."
gardening,"I'm not sure, but my ghost peppers developed something that looks like this after I brought them indoors for the cold months. It seemed to be a reaction to the change from sunlight to grow lights. Not saying this is what's going on with your plant, since it's a different type of plant and I am no expert, but I figured it was worth mentioning just in case."
gardening,Last week the same here and I still use a puffer jacket and central heating. Then I open Reddit to see Florida guys' plants üòÇüòà.

gardening,"From one nOOb to another: plant multiples of things 3 strawberries, 3 peppers, 3 tomatoes, etc. My first year I planted only one of each and was super discouraged when each plant didn't survive, or didn't produce, or produced a disappointing amount. Next year I planted three of everything I wanted to grow, and ended up with at least one of each plants happy and productive. :-)"
gardening,Yeah I definitely would prefer a dwarf variety since I'll be growing it in a container.  I've heard pomegranates are a good option!
gardening,"Yeah, that looks like cilantro."
gardening,I think there‚Äôs a Mexican plum variety that would work. Maybe pomegranates. Any dwarf species?
gardening,"Those sounds like instructions to a very productive and healthy garden. Much like a baking recipe, I feel like this may be only half of the equation. Whoever came up with this advice is very well seasoned for the area that they deal with."
gardening,Yes
gardening,"I think a bit of the stigma comes from the facts that their products are a decent bit more expensive than the ones that are not treated by them. They do grow exceptionally well, and some people think it's worth it. For others it's just unnecessary expense.


For me the difference is about $3, so yeah I'm going to go for the miracle grow."

It is very hardy with little bulbs underground, and will establish beds that grow larger and greener leaves if you allow it a couple of years, with more dense sprays of purple and white viola flowers.

I actually like it as a volunteer in some places, and have allowed it to take over a nice semi-shady patch around one of my maple trees and in another strip along the path next to my driveway by just not mowing it down. It's much more attractive than the dandelions and henbit that can't compete in the areas where it dominates. And weirdly my dog sometimes seeks out the big green leaves for a salad snack."
gardening,Looks good. Just curious but why raise it off the ground?
gardening,You‚Äôre so welcome!

gardening,"Don't ever try to clean up the root ball. You have one of two options: almost no roots on your indoor plants and outdoor trees, or completely root bound because they try to make the pot look ""full and healthy""."
gardening,This can be a sign of overwatering
gardening,"My condolences for your plants. :( 

Frost dates are useful, but they are often misinterpreted. Frequently, when people look for their frost date they find their *average* last frost date. Since it's an average, fully half of years will have frost later than that. Frost *free* dates, on the other hand, mean that 9 out of 10 years you're in the clear, which is much more reliable. 'Course, that still leaves about one year each decade that will fuck you up, and the cold snap last night might have made 2021 that shitty year in a lot of areas. 

Even besides the fact that frost dates are just probabilities, they still leave a lot out when comes to planning when to put plants out. A lot comes down to simply obsessively checking the weather, and the rest is knowing your climate. For instance, my area, Southeastern Pennsylvania, has a similar *average* last frost date as Southern Iowa, but we are a subtropical climate and they are a continental one, which basically means their temperatures vary much more wildly. Sure, Iowa often gets some nice, 70F days in mid-April, but a 50-degree cold snap is not unheard of for them. But here in SEPA, the risk of sub-28F lows is basically over by early March. The low temps we risk by planting on the early side are much more survivable than the late hard freezes that happen sometimes in the Midwest. Last night was about as bad a late cold event as I've seen, but it only got down to 35 when all was said and done.  So someone in Iowa should proceed much more cautiously with regards to cold damage than people in my neck of the woods."

gardening,"It‚Äôs worth noting that sometimes Meyer lemons are rooted cuttings, not grafted. You‚Äôll need to check the foliage on the shoots from the rootstock to see what it is. Trifoliate orange or citrange will have palmate, compound leaves, while if they were not grafted or if they were grafted onto sour orange, the leaves will look like regular citrus leaves. At least from the photos you posted, it looks like it‚Äôs either own-rooted or grafted onto sour orange.

You‚Äôll want to scratch + sniff the leaves once they open up to figure out what type they are ‚Äî they have distinctive aromas: Meyer lemon will have a lemony odor but sour orange has a sweet, almost grapefruity odor on the leaves."

Edited to add: It can be caused by insufficient light, water, or nutrients or by introducing a contaminated plant."

gardening,"Good luck and if they don‚Äôt do well or put out much fruit this year, they‚Äôll probably do better next year. Mine did! :)"
gardening,"Great question. I would say generally they‚Äôre MUCH sweeter/juicier/deliciouser. However, I‚Äôm not a fan of the everbearing type (which these are), because these seem more tart. I think the flavor of ‚Äúnormal‚Äù strawberries is much better but the problem with them is they only fruit once a year and somehow I never get any because critters. 

All this with the caveat that I do not like strawberries from the store AT ALL, so even the more tart everbearing ones are better IMO. 

Really I think everything home grown is so much better. Farmers markets are a second best. Grocery stores are ‚Äúmeh‚Äù after growing your own anything. 

Hope that helps!"

gardening,"Thanks! I went for the toothpick and cup of water method, but that was purely because this is my first try and I wanted to see it as it happened.

You take the pit out of an avo, peel the dark skin off carefully (optional, but prevents it rotting into the water. I used the tip of a fine knife and took my time).

Face the flatter (broad) side down, and poke in 3 toothpicks at 45 degrees toward the top of the seed so that with will sit on the rim of a cup and hold the seed a bit below the top of the cup. Fill it up with water to cover about an inch of the seed. It should look like [this](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSHXxGzRoCKNIryedXdqCqrSN1Lqjkq5js98A&amp;usqp=CAU)

Over the first 4 weeks the seed slowly split in two, held together in the middle, and from that middle part a tap root slowly grew down. Once it was about 2 inches long (no stem growth for me at that stage) I moved it to the soil in a very tall pot to give the tap root room. I left just the tip exposed as you can see in my post. 

If you leave it to grow as is, after many years it will fruit and probably taste horrible. I believe 1/50,000 is ""good"". I will cut the whole plant off when the stem is approaching 1cm thick leaving just 15cm of stem sticking out of the soil. Then I will take a cutting of a similar thickness branch of fresh growth from a mature tree of my target type of avo (I like hass) and will do a cleft graft. Once it heals and hopefully takes all future growth will have Hass genetics and as it is a scion from a mature tree it will also fruit years sooner.

This is all in theory, I've never done it before, this is a bit of a hail mary just for fun. I'm going into winter now though so time to buy a small grow light so it doesn't die after all my love I gave it 

Sorry for the wall of text, I like to be thorough haha"

The cool thing I read about is it doesn't get very tall and stays in a column.  I'm going to try to order at least another one for the pollination.  I guess that is how they get you to spend money."

gardening,"Moved a couple years ago and kept seeing a full parking lot at a nursery across the street from an orange store. Took me until last Fall to visit, thinking it was out of my price range. Now I'm there every week, because they have in-house grown plants cheaper than the Neonicotinoid-laden box-store stuff, AND you know it will grow because they grow it all there, less than a mile from my house."

gardening,"Each stalk can produce a banana rack, but once that individual stalk is harvested it won‚Äôt flower again.

5c perlite

5c vermiculite

2c worm castings.

The reason I'm adding this recipe is the worm castings have humic acid, which aids germination and naturally buffers the starter mix."

However, I have a big area in the back of my lot where leaves have been dumped for years.  It's also near a small creek (my lot slopes down toward the creek). The soil under and around the leaves is very rich.

Can I use that soil in my garden?  How do I prep it?  Should I be worried about bugs/weeds and how do I get rid of those?

Thanks a million!"

gardening,"That's fantastic to hear! It's so frustrating after the effort and expense of getting plants into the garden to lose them. On the other hand it's a real win when they come through a snap like that.

I had garlic with about 6 inches of growth and it got down to 12 degrees Monday night. They were under about 5 inches of snow. The tops of the leaves poking out are black and folded over, but the bulk of the green growth is going to be ok. Snow is an amazing insulator."

gardening,"I'm sorry, I just find it so cute that you're counting th3 flowers and stems...it makes me think of how I wish I could feel that first girlfriend/boyfriend feeling again lol. 

Yes, absolutely put mulch, especially for containers. It helps keep the soil cool, helps it retain moisture, in turn helps keep the micro life in the soil. It also keeps the fruit off the soil, helping to prevent fungus and such.

You like that pot for strawberries? If so keep them in there. Strawberries make new babies my putting out ""runners"". A long ""stem"" will spread and on the end will start growing a new plant. Just take those and put them in the new pot or area and keep the original in the original pot."

These are grafted onto trifolate rootstock from cuttings off mature trees so they don't need the usual 3-5 years to start fruiting.

If you‚Äôd prefer the rocks closer to the house I would add the mulch there - which could help with water retention as well. No need to add compost if nothing new is planted. 

Either way will need fertilizer so the bushes and any perennials trying to start the new season get nutrients :)"
gardening,"Well, it looks like it's dead, but try pruning back some branches and see if you see any green inside.

gardening,"I think that only applies to certain types of seeds. It looks like you have a mix of several different types there?

Remember that different types of seeds are adapted to different methods of distribution. Sinking would probably be detrimental for some of them. Some that fall on the ground right below their parent plant probably benefit by being carried by rain water. Coconuts specifically rely on floating to colonize new areas. I can't imagine that a sunflower seed wouldn't float, and looking at the shape of them it almost seems like they're meant to flow on water easily. Just like seeds that disperse in the wind often have little 'sails' built in to carry them.

I wouldn't worry too much about it. Just always overplant and thin out the extras."

gardening,"Miracle grow isn't as popular with the new generation of experienced gardeners but it may be q good suggestion for new gardeners because it has fertilizer already in it.

The more sun the better for strawberries, at least here in Detroit. 

Mulch...or get this, straw lol is really important for all plants but especially strawberries. 

I water mine on the same schedule as my tomatoes and peppers which is I try to do once a day. The mulch will help prevent drying out.

They spread quite a bit. A $7 plant spread to fill a 4x4 bed in its first year for me. 

Good luck"

gardening,"[Bee pollination declining with increased use of pesticide](https://apnews.com/article/fd43025a02054f6d8dc4735c871da7d1) (APNews):  

&gt; Bobby Coy and his son, Richard Coy, owners of Crooked Creek Bee Co., in Jonesboro, began noticing a decline in bee pollination after nearby farmers began using the pesticide dicamba on nearby crops during the past three years.

&gt; It‚Äôs gotten bad enough to force the Coys to move their operations to southern Mississippi to escape the effects of the dicamba spray, The Jonesboro Sun reported .

&gt; The herbicide has been used by farmers who plant soybean and cotton crops that have been genetically modified to be tolerant of the chemical because it is effective in killing pigweed.

&gt; But dicamba does damage to other soybean crops, along with watermelons, pecans, peaches, tomatoes and other vegetables and other plants essential for bee-pollination and for migrating butterflies."

gardening,"Lavender roots are very sensitive to prolonged moisture and will rot in a heartbeat. It must be in sandy soil. For me, that meant removing a lot of my clay and replacing it with a sandy mix. If you are growing in containers, regular potting mix isn't the way to go. Use cactus or succulent mix or mix lots of sand in with potting mix. Overwatering kills more lavender than under-watering and they both cause the plant to wilt."

gardening,"While those lilacs are small I‚Äôd bring them way further out from the house - or make sure you trim them back that size after they finish flowering each spring. 

Aside from the one that looks like it got a bit cold (will probably bounce back tho) your plants look good!! I think you might like the overall look better if you cleaned up the borders - it can be more work but it they are clean and squared up it will make the overall effect so much nicer."

I also grow cilantro yr round using 1 15watt fixture.

gardening,"It isn't the sun, per se, as peonies love sun. It is in a pot that is way too small, which may be full of roots, if it is more than a year old, and it is being baked from underneath by the patio. 

Peony roots extend out at least 5 inches from the base of the plant all around, and almost that deep. They don't like being dry. 

If you had a big enough pot, the leaves would be over the pot and not getting hit by the heat reflected off the patio. Since it is already setting buds, you don't want to repot now, but get it off the patio while keeping it in the sun, and check the moisture down an inch or so into the pot and water accordingly."

gardening,"The issue of fertilizer runoff is real and some people assume that organic is better than manufactured chemicals. Adding something like compost improves the soil which MG doesn't. It also adds micronutrients; I don't know if MG does that. I live in a place with naturally high phosphorus levels. Adding more via conventional fertilizer can lead to phos. toxicity over time. One formulation for everything from tomatoes to flowers seems weird. So, I think that there are a variety of reasons. If it works for you and you follow the instructions / directions, then go for it. My goal is to nourish the soil so that I don't need to fertilize plants."

gardening,"&gt;il looks rather dry and you should thin them out to one seedling per a cell . They are most likely also in shock because they are being transferred from a closet to sunlight. Seedlings need 12-18 hours of light a day to develop properly, you could consider putting a growlight in your closet.

Good to know, I had no idea the difference in sunlight could cause shock. Thanks!  
I'll have to look into getting a grow light, since I don't have any. Wouldn't the hours of exposure to the sun be enough, though? I think there's about 11 hours of sunlight in my city at this time of year."

Almost all of these companies declare on their websites that they are not able to ship their catalogs outside the US. I find these catalogs to be very useful in a printed version because it is not only more convenient to have it at hand, but also it is like encyclopedia that has a lot of inspiring and valued information and would help to plan our future garden. 

Since we do not have any friends or relatives in the United States, I would like to know is there anyone who could help us with this question. The ideal version would be to find a person who is planning to come to Europe (either to the United Kingdom or Norway) from the US this year and could take these magazines with itself, only in case there would be an extra space in the luggage. But I am not sure whether it is the best idea. If you have any suggestions, I would be happy to hear it. :) Thank you!"
gardening,"Oh no...sounds like a cat hahaha. Here's hoping the plants stay as healthy as they can, they get outside soon, and your cat behaves üòÇ"
gardening,Needs 8 hours of sun and I don't see anything wrong with it.
gardening,Same. I do the whole plant at least 3 in one spot to make sure the chances are that one actually grows....I always end up with like a 95% success rate and have a part time job thinning plants lol
gardening,"Normal, don't worry about it, you have worse problems with lack of light.   If you have grow lights, they should be on 16 hours a day.  Also, if you have heat mats they should be off.  You want stocky plants which means cooler and brighter."
gardening,*Three different studies.
gardening,"There's no way marigold seeds would ever sink, and i think even a tiny fraction of a marigold seeds will still grow a happy healthy plant."

You want me to send you a seedling? They‚Äôre borderline invasive here."
gardening,Keep it. Plant it. Mine grew and grew. It was beautiful.
gardening,"I'm jealous, I planted some milkweed seeds last winter hoping that they would germinate but nothing came up."
gardening,I'd say no to a free bradford pear tree- they smell awful in bloom! üòÇ
gardening,Yours will still be gorgeous when the rest are played out.
gardening,"I have a soil thermometer, I have no clue from year to year.  Also I use a moisture meter for my pots because I have no clue by looking at them if they need water.  Around June is my best guess. I know I plant cucumbers and pole beans around the 2nd week of June, but one June was nasty, and I didn't get any in till July.  And you may say, how late.  By October I can't stand to look at another one, let alone eat them, LOL!!! I make a lot of pickles.  By the time you're on your 80th tomato, the same thing happens."
gardening,I want one of these as a part of my garden but I haven't been able to find one. I would prefer to buy the complete setup all in one so that way I can learn about them while having Hands-On practice with one and then maybe buying components in different parts of another one later to put together.
gardening,not technically fruit (or nuts) but pretty good in some pesto!
gardening,"Mine too! It seems like they have a meeting every year to decide what ""deer resistant"" plant they're going to eat. One year it was Columbine. One year Lily of the Valley. Last year it was Aster. Apparently this year it was my lilac buds. üò°"
gardening,"The first and last pics look great! You can cut off the lilac flowers when they're done, they'll come back next spring. The second pic looks like the plant may have had some cold damage but wait and see if it recovers :) you're doing just fine! it's all about trying things out and figuring out what works. I've had plenty of fails but it helped me learn a lot about my plants and what they like/don't like. You'll get better and better each year!"
gardening,Now thats a five star man.
gardening,No prob! Good luck!
gardening,No snow in L.A. but all of a sudden no sun for a week. üò≠ my half germinated tomato seedlings died!
gardening,Roundup!? Yikes. I would be mad about either.
gardening,"We think that every, every time."
gardening,"The idiot who wrote this ""study"" does not know the difference between Pesticide and Herbicide, ""Studies"" done by the illiterate can be dismissed out of hand. Peculiarly if they don't know to control for the most obvious variable Insecticidal soap like all soaps is a ""Surfactant"" and if you spray insects with it you will kill them, The Rocket surgeons who unloaded this crap sprayed it directly on the bees, just like is very unlikely to happen in the real world. In other words in the extremely unlikely event that this has any value what so ever the only thing we could conclude is soaps can kill insects if you spray it directly on them, just like the instructions on insecticidal soap say to."
gardening,"Hmm, looks like some type of weed but I‚Äôm not sure what kind"
gardening,This explains why my farmer neighbor has nothing in his garden while I was huffing and puffing. I must‚Äôve looked like such a newb.
gardening,"They survived!! Covered with mulch, 2 blankets and 2 tarps. Under freezing for 2 night and they are still in great shape!"
gardening,One of my cats pissed in my nasturtiums and the other trampled 2 of my other plants. I can't wait to move them out. Atleast I caught her right away and the piss plants are doing good.
gardening,I never heard or knew that. But it seems like you got plenty of seed to me. And I also only plant from seed and it seems to me no seed is never not viable.
gardening,üòÇ
gardening,"Oof, I felt that"
gardening,[deleted]
gardening,Well as per usual if they're dry on the Browning spot there's lack of water and if they're wet maybe too much or humidity is really bad. I would also check soil conditions.

I don't use selfwatering for house because I use a moisture meter and it's not hard to keep them watered.  Veggies and flowers. I don't see why ornamental seasonal would be a problem. Some of them:  [https://imgur.com/KJXXcxe](https://imgur.com/KJXXcxe)I still don't see the problem you have with them.  [Gardeners.com](https://Gardeners.com) has good ones, they cost but over 30 years the costs on mine aren't much a year.  The company has been in business for a long time."

gardening,"Yup, just some frost damage :)"
gardening,Looks like Begonia boliviensis
gardening,Hope that helps
gardening,"Yes, i hardened them off for a month or more in pots slowly working them more and more into the sun until they were all the way exposed. I‚Äôm in zone 8a and the temps have been kinda sporadic lately. Also I live out in the country with no wind breaks so the wind often is 15-20 mph. I attack them to the bamboo poles you see and monitor them and they seem to be taking it ok"
gardening,Begonia boliviensis?
gardening,It's a begonia. Google Lens or PlantNet could have told you this in 60 seconds.
gardening,First looks like climbing aloe and the second I'd say is a type of graptosedum
gardening,"A starter garden?!! This is no starter garden, this is a FINISHER garden!!!

Edit: lol just saw that a top comment already made this joke. Oh well I'm leaving it up so that it can burn up with the rest of the ill-timed jokes and go up and become the stars in the sky."
gardening,so relaxing
gardening,"Big box stores suck for seeds imo. I hope what you can save will flourish for you. Thanks on the aloe comment. I changed their soil entirely (I'll never buy ""for cactus soil"" again) and they are fighting hard for sure. I lost 5 pups due to my mistake. Oh well, we live and we learn I suppose."

gardening,I need my tools!
gardening,I learned today. Thank u
gardening,"I get it, it sucks.  I started it all from seeds it's all stuff you can't get in the big box stores.  Good luck on the aloe plant, just don't water it I've kept mine alive more by neglect lol."
gardening,Yup.. I‚Äôm the dumbass who planted my tomatoes 2 weeks ago and now they are practically dead from frost.. tried to cover them last night but now the leaves look like cooked spinach hanging off the branches
gardening,I read an article once about how milkweed attracts butterflies. They need it to survive.

gardening,"Hi, I am a beginning gardener in south CA.

When is it the best time to plant peppers, and which type should I plant if I want to ferment them for hot sauce?"
gardening,You can stick your finger in the soil and if it‚Äôs wet beyond an inch no need to water. Water once a week.
gardening,You might be able to cut the dead leaves off and TRY to get it to grow back but that‚Äôs a big if. Give it some miracle grow or blood/bone meal and give it a shot. Might be just too late üôÅ
gardening,Thank you for this. People wanted to know why I seemed so upset. Lol.
gardening,My 2 year old would beg to differ.
gardening,Vermont checking in. This is accurate.

gardening,"I remember visiting my dad in Chicago in February one year (I was living in Winnipeg at the time, which is notorious for their cold weather). 

It was so nice. Light snow that melted when it hit the ground. I left the house in a cozy sweater and my step sister couldn‚Äôt believe it. Thought I would be freezing... meanwhile it was -45C in Winnipeg."
gardening,"Roses, pansies, borage, dandelions, squash/zucchini flowers, hibiscus (perennial in zone 6 if overwintered indoors), chamomile, lavender, purslane, honeysuckle, calendula, violets, sage flowers, and many more.

gardening,Make sure you research if you need a permit or not. You usually need a permit for retaining walls.
gardening,"Thank you! I watched the video and did just as she said. I could definitely feel some roots tearing but I managed to separate the two plants and keep two intact rootballs, so  ü§û that they both survive!"
gardening,Awwww this makes me sad
gardening,So they are. I first thought geranium but the leaves didn‚Äôt look right. Same advice though. Full sun and dry between waterings.
gardening,Well mine had stopped blooming at least.
gardening,And that is why I dont plant until the last frost date.
gardening,"This is exactly what I needed, the fence is chain link so not a concern there. Thanks!"
gardening,If you‚Äôre just looking to prune the lower branches so you‚Äôre able to mow underneath Google the 3 cut method.
gardening,Thanks! I‚Äôm new to gardening.
gardening,Judging by how much birds love to eat... I wouldn‚Äôt even bother.
gardening,You could trim off the dead leaves and it should keep growing. Put a plastic bag over it next time the temperature drops.
gardening,There are a lot of youtube videos showing how to make this type of system yourself fairly easily.
gardening,"Watch ""Jeb Gardener"" on YouTube

gardening,These are really cool. Taste is basically the same as a eureka lemon but they really do ripen with green streaks on the skin and a pinkish orange inside. Thought it was a marketing gimmick till I actually grew one.
gardening,Thanks. They looked fine when I got home. I was mostly worried because we just planted them last weekend.
gardening,"We've lost a young clematis to ours. We talk to our guys each year about A) don't you dare spray this lawn and B) leave the daffodils until they die back. They don't always get the second part but the plants do get a few extra weeks and have managed to keep going. Hopefully yours will too. 

What kills me is that the daffodils are in a bed outlined in rocks. Why would you get in there? Leave it be! I'm not sure how they'll treat my annual flowers I'm putting in after the bulbs are done this year."
gardening,"Have had success with Gnatrol as well as using Bush Doctor _Force of Nature_. Not a promotion, just stating what‚Äôs worked for us over 1000+ starts this year."

gardening,Such beautiful flowers!
gardening,"Mine died last year, happens.  Wasn't the soil, new potting mix.  It is weather usually.  I find some years are good for one thing and crappy for another.  Last year was cucumbers galore and hardly any tomatoes.  One three year period, I couldn't get a decent crop of hot peppers then the fourth year a ton."
gardening,I signed up for this thing at exactly midnight last week so I wouldn't miss it! Wonder what kind of fruit we'll get? Maybe pine-apples...
gardening,I‚Äôm thinking about starting a pothos wall. Is this a good idea? The plant doesn‚Äôt seem to attract bugs
gardening,It was most likely given a growth regulator by the grower to keep it short which could be why the side flowers look a bit wonky.
gardening,This.
gardening,That's exciting!  I bet they'll look just as beautiful
gardening,"You need to prune the shoots. Like a 90 degree growth is good but if a 45 degree angle out, prune that. Makes the plant more attractive."

gardening,"Clematis like lots of sun and cool roots, it is recommended to mulch them to keep them cool.  So cold temperatures may burn the leaves but not harm the roots and they will come back."
gardening,"Honestly it's one of the reasons why I'm too afraid to grow anything from seeds. I don't have the room inside for them as is, but I'd be heart broken over losing them as well outside even if I did have the room inside. But yet I'm just over here trying to save my aloe from root rot and I could cry over 2 years of work over a simple mistake so I get it. Even if the seeds don't cost a lot, it's sooooo much work to get them going."

gardening,"These are nice, but there are a lot of choices and LEDs last a long time, I have some that are 8 years old.  Florescent are more hot and use more energy and the thing people don't know about them is after a few months they start getting dimmer.  You don't notice because it is so slow in happening.  A friend of mine is a maintenance man and he clued me into this.  There is a lot of good info shown, so you should read it whether you are going to get these or not.

gardening,"What type of planters? House plants, veggies ornamental/seasonal pots?
These ones are for ornamental/seasonal plants"
gardening,Starting to see more and more photos of full blooms covered in snow. I‚Äôm happy mine haven‚Äôt broke dormancy yet.
gardening,Search Regal Geraniums or their Latin name Pelargonium grandiflorum. Some older cultivars are spring flowering while newer ones will flower all season. Wait for the soil to dry slightly then water thoroughly. Till water runs out the bottom of the pot. In cool weather thats probably every few days and in the summer once or twice a day .
gardening,Looks like mosaic virus to me.
gardening,Gorgeous!
gardening,"Morning glory don't like cold.  You can't rush some things.   I am in zone 5 and I don't start some plants till June.  May is too cold and you don't gain anything by planting early, the plants just sit there waiting for warmth."

gardening,Thank you. When does your soil temps hit 70f consistently? I‚Äôm in New England and it can take awhile to get to that consistent temp.
gardening,"7a here as well. I've learned to not plant anything new until mid-late May. My daylilies and butterfly bushes sprouted leaves a few weeks ago, but we were lucky to not fully reach freezing. Some how my house also got skipped on snow as it snowed 10 minutes north and 20 minutes south of us with visible snow still on the ground. High 70s earlier than day. Lol"
gardening,maybe a pine twig?
gardening,Did you harden them off before planting them out?
gardening,"Thank you for your encouragement. For a fertilizer, do you suggest a diluted all around fertilizer like a 10-10-10. Or should I focus on something that promotes just root growth?"

gardening,1 part peroxide 4 part water  and pour on top of the soil until you get a tad of runoff - it will kill them
gardening,"Could be wrong but the middle one looks like a wire worm. Bad, but inevitable. Will eat roots and ground veggies. You can catch them by leaving slices of potatoes in the soil and checking them every day, they'll come and hangout as they chow.

gardening,"Question for my fellow canadian gardeners out here. 

I have goji berries that have over wintered, and already has flower buds.. did this freeze just kill my plant? Should I bring it inside? Or just leave it outside?"

gardening,"Perhaps. Looks like it‚Äôs in fair shape now but may need trimming in time. I think it‚Äôs worth a knock on your neighbors door to get an ok, let them know it might need to be trimmed to stay healthy. Or if you‚Äôre lucky, the town might take care of it.

gardening,"the ""average last frost"" date is usually calculated looking at historical data for a given area. For the time period in the sample, half of the years had a ""last frost"" earlier than the average date and half of the years had a ""last frost"" later than the average date, hence it being the average. Frequently, people will want greater than 50% chance that the last frost has passed before planting, so they will use a later date with a higher degree of confidence. For example, say the average ""last frost"" date for my area, based on historical data, was May 1st. By May 10th there might be a 70% chance that the last frost has passed, and 90% by May 20th."

gardening,"The soil looks rather dry and you should thin them out to one seedling per a cell . They are most likely also in shock because they are being transferred from a closet to sunlight.

I live in Texas. The latest we've ever had a freeze since I've been gardening is the first week of April. Here we are, almost to the last week and I'm running around putting as many plants as I can inside and thanking all that is holy that I accidentally ordered an extra roll of plastic when I did the Blackberries. I was able to cover my little tomato and pepper seedlings in one sheet

I used trash bags to cover the less than a year old Wisteria and the peach tree we started from seed last year and my poor purple prickly pear that all but one pad turned to mush from our horrible winter

This winter has been the worst I can ever remember. It's like a bad ex that keeps dropping by for that one last thing they forgot, I swear"
gardening,"Looks like mild sunburn possibly in combination with some cold damage. Peppers and especially anything in the squash family are very sensitive to cold. 

The soil looks somewhat dry too. Regular consistent watering is necessary for optimal growth. Slowly adjust them to outdoor conditions keeping them only in the shade at first then slowly allow them more and more direct sun over the course of a week. 

Also giving them some fertilizer mixed at half strength would be very beneficial.

Overall your plants look great though, I'd be proud of they were mine."
gardening,My old people gardening friends are all eyeing next week to plant. I think I'm gonna follow their lead.
gardening,"Starts and also forced bloom ones! At mine, the in-bloom fuchsias are usually on carts outside the garden center gate, so they‚Äôre not very obvious if you have gone there through the main store.

We had 8 tomato and pepper seedlings he had already put in the ground just off patio. So I covered them with glass jars since they were only 4 inches high.

I also agree much to big a pot and too much water.  Peat wicks water out.  So if you use them, you have to be careful to water well and let dry.  I've had small plants in small cells dry out.  Last week two peppers shriveled.  I transplanted them with the others into 4"" pots and now I can't tell which they were, dry is better than mud.  You just soak them and they should come back.  Also they don't look like they got much light.  You should get grow light.  You keep it on for 16 hours a day so LED is best."

Shop lights that are fluorescent or LED will work. Ideally get 5,000K or higher temp rating.

I had thought the problem was cucumber beetles but I've only seen 5 in my whole garden and never on this plant. I don't know if they do secret night time feeding but I'd think if they caused this much damage to the plant I would have seen some on it at some point.

Now I am thinking it might be a watering issue? I have started watering the plant more often but am kind of confused because the black beauty next to it is thriving with the same watering.

The second pic is of my cucumber. That plant seems very healthy and the longest vine is about 6 feet at this point and it has set several fruits. I just noticed today some of the lower leaves have this mottled look and am worried it might be starting to do whatever the zucchini is doing.

gardening,In Monty Don's last book he hammers it home: you can't cheat the seasons.
gardening,"Unless the fence is, like, 10 feet tall and is solid concrete or wood, it doesn't cast that much shade at its base. No matter which way a mixed perennials bed is oriented, tall things go in the back, medium things in the middle, and short things in the front, the way that you stand up children for a concert with the tall ones in the back and the small ones in front.

So a perennial border along a southern fence line, running from east to west, would have the tall things against the fence, i.e. the south side of the border, and the shortest things in front, i.e. the north side of the border.

The rule about putting tall things across the north end applies more to things that are drastically taller than their friends, such as cucumbers on a trellis and bean plants. Most perennials are pretty similar in size, except for things like hollyhocks, so there's not a lot of shading that goes on.  The fence is more of a shade factor, depending on what kind and size it is."
