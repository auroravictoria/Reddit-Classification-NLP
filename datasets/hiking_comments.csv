It's not ankle support (boots don't help that much until you get to plastics or ski boots), it's having a stiffer sole for rocky bits, the ability to do a bit of edging in scrambling situations, the ability to traverse snow and kick steps, and the ability to keep scree out.

And I know you‚Äôve heard this but go SUPER early. For everything. Earliest shuttle, earliest parking, earliest dinner. Crowds are killer but you can plan around them. 

The parking lot fills up around 7 and the only other places to park are $30 a day in town.

Some other things- the park pass is $35 for 7 day access. The narrows and angels landing will get crowded but they are so worth it. The other hikes are hit or miss, I‚Äôm doing Deer trap and Cable Mountain today so I‚Äôll report back. 

Outside of the park and Springdale there‚Äôs nothing. Seriously it‚Äôs empty. But as for other hikes / things to do. Check out lake Powell, Antelope Canyon in Arizona, or Bryce Canyon!

Lots of apps can open a GPX file.  Including the app you used to track it so you could get your friends to download OSMAnd as well, or one of the other offline navigation apps, share your GPX route with them, and they will be able to see the route and follow it on an offline topo map on their phones.

If you haven‚Äôt camped or hiked before it‚Äôs a really good idea to do some one or two night trips before the big trip, to make sure you have what you need and know how it works. 

Simplicity is key, and carrying only what you need. I‚Äôll give you my typical packing list so you can look some things up. My tent is a Tarptent Rainbow, one to two person, with bug netting and built in groundsheet. Weighs just under 1kg. In mild weather I use two 7mm closed cell foam sleeping mats, from Decathlon, about ¬£5 each. They fold easily for packing and one goes under my tent groundsheet to protect it, the other inside. I use either a down sleeping bag (Mountain Equipment, bought used off eBay, down bags last for decades) or a lightweight down quilt (Sierra designs Backcountry 40). 

Your clothes need to be comfortable, lightweight, fast drying. And not too many! Two pairs underwear (lightweight anti chafe synthetic boxers) two t shirts (Danish Endurance tencel, don‚Äôt get smelly) , three pairs socks (Danish Endurance running socks), Mountain Hardwear lightweight nylon trousers, North Face nylon sun shirt, Berghaus fleece jacket, Marmot waterproof jacket, Gore-Tex Paclite waterproof trousers, Merrel Moab Ventilator shoes or Nike Flyknit trainers. Sun hat, fleece hat, nylon shorts, foam flip flops or sandals. Everything is fast drying so I can wash and wear. 

Don‚Äôt try to hike too far too soon. No
more than 10 miles a day at first. Blisters are common if you overdo it so take it slow and carry compeed blister pads. 

You‚Äôll need a good torch too, the Petzl zipka is great. If you want to be more stealthy with your camping you can use a bivy bag like the Alpkit Hunka. Much lighter but not so good in wet weather. 

There are often good packs on eBay, you‚Äôll probably need something 45-65 litres depending on how much food you‚Äôre carrying and how compact your sleeping bag is. Ultralight hikers often use frameless packs to save weight but I‚Äôd advise you to get one with an internal frame and a comfortable hip belt. There‚Äôs a very nice Osprey Aether 60 pack on eBay U.K. right now, orange, used, low auction price. You‚Äôd be happy with that.

I don‚Äôt usually use stoves now myself, but the simplest and lightest would be a basic alcohol stove under a titanium or aluminium pot. 

The best solar panel I know of at the moment is the Anker Powerport. You hang it on your pack.",,,1619045147,{},gvdowah,False,t3_mvmzki,False,True,t3_mvmzki,/r/hiking/comments/mvmzki/im_going_on_a_trip_and_im_not_sure_how_to_prepare/gvdowah/,1619062923,2,True,False,hiking,t5_2r9om,,0,[],,

It will take a month I think and I'm not really following a trail, just sort of going in a direction and wild camping where I can. if that sentence makes you want to put me off then I was right to leave it out XD

Another mile or so hiking down, the sky started getting dark and then it started raining, and of course more thunder. At this point, my first thought was to head down as low on the mountain as possible, so I started running downhill.

I was in the middle of a forest, so avoiding trees was not possible, and some people were huddling against trees (which I didn't think was wise, since if a tree is struck the charge can go down on the surface of the bark to the ground). 

One lightning strike was so close I was momentarily blinded by the intense light, felt the charge on my skin and hair, and smelled the electrical smell in the air. I think the strike was mere metres from me. I didn't stop to find out.

I did make it down unscathed, but this did put the fear in me. I now avoid being high up in the mountains after noon during monsoon season (July through early September here).

I honestly don't know what the absolute best choice would be, but I would suggest **not** being on a ridgeline, and not being next to isolated trees.",,,1619038920,{},gvdbeuj,False,t3_mvmbp1,False,True,t3_mvmbp1,/r/hiking/comments/mvmbp1/hiking_in_a_thunderstorm_what_are_you_actually/gvdbeuj/,1619055589,2,True,False,hiking,t5_2r9om,,0,[],,

Mostly dreading bringing so much of it. Below is what I have previously done for 9 day stretches. Is this the best or healthiest meal plan? Absolutely not. But it did the job for both speed and space efficiency. 

From my memory here is roughly what I ate everyday:

\-2 Cliff bars each morning first thing before leaving camp

\-Instant coffee as I hiked

\-1 or 2 Snicker/Cliff Bars/Almond Butter Squeeze Packs (The Justin Squeeze Packs are really packable and 200 calories a pack) a couple hours in

\-Lunch was always tortilla with mayo, hot sauce, cheese and a tuna pack. If I ran out of tuna I'd use nut butter instead. I would also eat some candy like skittles or something

\-Afternoon snack was the same as morning snack, something I could eat while walking

\-Dinner was a rotation of Ramen noodles or Idaho Potatoes with Cheese and sometime mayo and hot sauce added. I often added olive oil to my ramen to add calories. Afterwards I sometimes made hot chocolate or ate some more candy if I still had some. 

My shopping list was somewhat like this for 9 days:

\-About 3 boxes of granola bars (Clif and Lara were my favourites)

\-1 Box of Justin's Almond butter packs 

\-A pack of Snickers

\-A block of hard cheddar cheese

\-A bag of tortillas 

\-As many mayo, mustard, hot sauce packs from fast food places as I could muster

\-A little squeeze bottle of Olive oil

\-Instant Coffee

\-Mio Squeeze bottle for electrolytes

\-9 Tuna packs

\-4 Ramen packs

\-5 Packets of Idaho Potatoes

And then I would throw in random candy that I thought wasn't that heavy or hot chocolate packs. 

I'd say I was eating roughly 2400-2800 calories per day, depending on my snack consumption. I was also on the PCT and I was deliriously hungry at this point, so I don't think I'll bring as many bars or snacks this time, because I don't think I'll work up my appetite to that point. I'll probably keep the same eating schedule though. I may switch to oatmeal for breakfast instead, because I won't be doing such long days this time.

Meall a Choire Leith.

Meall Corranaich
Beinn Ghlas
Ben Lawers
An Stuc
Meall Garbh
(&amp; Finally) Meall Greigh

Visibility was fairly poor that morning, we couldn't see much more than 20 metres ahead until we reached Ben Lawers, from there on out it was possibly the most beautiful Scottish summers day I ever experienced.

It was quiet, the sun was out and we were midge free! We completed the range at around 4pm.

Up in the mountains it's usually not too bad, but once you get into the piedmont/costal region it can get pretty vicious. But it's something you learn to deal with. Get good bug spray, wear long sleeve shirts and pants ect. 

Though as a side anecdote, I once took a 3 day canoe trip down the lumber river (towards the coast, about an hour outside Wilmington) and brought hella bug spray and anti bug gear (it is literally a swamp, and we went in July).

[],,mountaininmysoul,,,[],,,,text,t2_4e7hdedy,False,False,[],"On valentine's day I went to do a fairly short desert hike with some slot canyons and a bit of cross country skills. I had notes, a map, compass etc. My notes said while hiking up a slot canyon to find a ""native american shelf"" to climb up the canyon wall. I couldn't find it, and eventually ran into a dry waterfall too big to get up. I turned back and found a small gully that I was able to climb up. What I didn't realize was the top wasn't the top and it kept getting steeper. I ended up on my hands and knees but made it up without to much problem.

 I was now on a giant plateau but my hike was supposed to be a loop so I wasn't too concerned with getting off. I found my way across to the other side of the plateau fairly easily but then couldn't find a trail down into the main canyon. My notes indicated a smaller canyon could be used to get out as well. So I tried every smaller canyon I could find only to get stopped by dry waterfalls everytime. 

I decided to go back to the other side of the plateau, thinking maybe I could find the ""shelf"" I was supposed to use to get up. I found an old trail that seemed to go where I needed it too  but the trail washed out and there was no way I could safely go any further on it. Annoyingly from that spot I could see my car. I tried to find where I came up but couldn't find the spot. I was finally able to descend into the canyon I climbed up. Idiot me ran into a small dry fall that I could climb down but felt I couldn't climb up. It should of occured to me that I hadn't seen this dry fall earlier. I got over it only to discover the big dry fall that I'd seen earlier was all of 10 yards past it. I was now stuck inside a narrow canyon without reception. 

Somehow by sheer force of will I was able to climb over the small fall and hiked down canyon but again was stopped by a dry fall. I tried climbing partially up the walls and seeing if I could work my way around to some place I could safely enter the canyon past the dry fall but alas the walls got too steep. I ended up climbing back up to the plateau and heading back to the other side. 

At this point my shadow was getting longer and I had some concerns about water. I heard a coyote in the distance and I was aware I might have to spend the night in the desert, which sounded very cold and not something I wanted to do. My girlfriend was obviously very freaked out, but luckily I had signal on top of the plateau.

While walking along I saw a faint trail hidden behind a hill that led into a canyon but didn't seem to climb out the other side. Annoyingly I had seen this trail earlier before I had attempted to get out and had forgotten about it. This trail actually climbed into a canyon I'd tried earlier in the day but had gotten stopped by a dry falls. I let my girlfriend know that if it did leave me out it would be 2 hours or so before I would have signal. Sure enough it led right out and I watched an amazing desert sunset. 

My short 7 mile, 3-4 hour hike turned into a 16+ mile, 10 hour hike. There was a wind advisory that day which made for some harrowing moments on a few very narrow and steep ridges. And I definitely ruined valentine's day but made it up for it the next night with some homemade sushi.

I had hiked one 14er at the time, and my roommates wanted to do Grays and Torreys. It was October, so I knew it'd be snowy. My boots were waterproof and warm enough to handle the low temperature, but they were unusually bad with ice. I bought a pair of Yaktrax for that reason.

Instead of digging into the snow and giving me traction, the Yaktrax trapped a bunch of snow to the bottom of my boots and packed it down.

We were in Red River Gorge, KY at Gray's Arch. It was early spring and there were still a lot of icicles on the cliffs. My 9-y-o son and I went over to where a row of them were dripping on the ground and I said to not go any closer than about 6 feet because you have no idea how big that ice is or when they may break off. We looked up for a few moments then backed away. When we were about 12-15 feet back, 2/3 of those icicles fell to the rocks with an impact that felt like a motor vehicle had just been dropped off the cliff. It was about a 70 foot drop and the impact would've been fatal had we lingered a step closer to where we were.

If you got the ankle strength/stamina for trailrunning multi day hikes in 12 hours, I guarantee that you will have no issues backpacking in those same shoes.
