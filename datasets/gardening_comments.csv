&gt;The costs of a delay can be substantial: e.g. a one year delay in approval of the pod-borer resistant cowpea in Nigeria will cost the country about 33 million USD to 46 million USD and between 100 and 3,000 lives.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5033189/

&gt;When it comes to GMO food crops, anti-GMO campaigners have thus won a remarkable yet dubious victory. They have not prevented rich countries from using GMO animal feed or GMO cotton, yet farmers and consumers in poor countries need increased productivity for food crops, not animal feed or industrial crops. Today's de facto global ban on GMO food crops therefore looks suspiciously like an outcome designed by the rich and for the rich, with little regard for the interests of the poor.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3674000/

&gt;Controlling for other factors, the adoption of GM cotton has significantly improved calorie consumption and dietary quality, resulting from increased family incomes. This technology has reduced food insecurity by 15–20% among cotton-producing households. GM crops alone will not solve the hunger problem, but they can be an important component in a broader food security strategy.

&amp;nbsp;

You aren't questioning the necessity. You're buying into literal corporate propaganda. The EWG isn't remotely credible because their positions regularly ignore scientific fact. Funny how your article quotes Gary Hirshberg but neglects to mention his other job.

All of those are fine when direct-seeded in the garden anyway, so the lack of seed-starting equipment is a non-issue. 


Those all benefit from cool, moist weather, which in your location is found in spring and fall. Except for the potatoes, which go all summer, they burn out when things start to heat up in July and August. 

If you're far enough north, you have a slightly different schedule than south, as your July and August may not be as hot as mine are.

The county extension office is a better source for a more specific planting schedule than the Almanac, which is necessarily somewhat general.

If you're going to grow tomatoes and peppers, you need lights, or buy plants.

1 American redbud

It's not really intended to be filled with other plants, too.  If you look on Google Images under things like ""urban tree street planters"", about half the people that have them opt for the zero-maintenance design choice of ""tree + mulch"", and omit anything else. 



Reasons:

1. If you put a mass planting of petunias or ivy or something in there, then they need to be hand-weeded, whereas mulch can simply be dumped to prevent weeds for  the benefit of the tree itself. 

2. Additional plantings are murder for collecting windblown trash and cigarette butts. All those candy wrappers and McDs bags and soda cups have to be pulled out by hand, by someone earning X number of dollars per hour to do so. 

3. The trees have an uphill survival battle as it is, with restricted root room, and water and nutrients availability. They don't really need additional competition.

4. Those I believe may technically be the property of the City or other municipality, same as the sidewalk. They may cede maintenance of them to the property owner adjoining the sidewalk, but they ultimately bear the responsibility for what's growing in them.  

5. I see, I guess, a couple of roses? They will not do well in the long-term, what with competition for light, nutrients, and water. Come back in 20 years and see.

6. Snow plows are also murder on planters.

In big blizzards, the kind of weather event where people mark their parking places with lawn chairs, the streetside planters can have plenty of salty slushy snow heaped up on them.

&gt;The previous board didn't maintain the landscaping whatsoever.

It may not be their problem, it may be the City's. Also, ""trees + mulch"" doesn't really require any debate about landscaping maintenance. Once a year, you get a guy to dump more mulch.

Trying to hopefully get some seeds in the ground over the weekend here but I'm finding a lot of information that revolves around starting seeds indoors which is making it challenging.

My issue is that I don't have any way to grow seeds indoors. I don't have grow lights, I don't have any good spaces near windows for getting sunlight, and I don't have any of the necessary equipment like the trays to grow indoors. I know a lot of people suggest to just buy the proper equipment so I can start seeds early but considering this is my first season I'm trying to lean a bit lighter on the expenses to just get a feel for gardening.

This weekend (04/25), I was considering planting carrots, radishes, and chives. But according to the growing calendar on [almanac.com](https://almanac.com) for my area, these should have been planted at least 10-15 days prior (25 days+ for radishes...) so I'm thinking I may be too late on these? Not sure if I can still squeeze them in this late.

The following weekend (05/02), I am looking to plant potatoes, cilantro, and onions. Again according to the same growing calendar, it seems like these all can be direct sown in late april/early may so I feel a little more confident in these.

I was thinking of just surrounding the area that is green (over the septic tank) and just letting this spot grow wild. Well, kind of...I want to put some decorative stones around it, and will edge it and make sure that it doesn't get too wild, but I want to let it be a nice place for the insects to enjoy while still being able to mow the rest of the yard.

My husband says that if I just surround it with rocks, I will somehow ""cut it off"" from light/water/proper drainage/etc and I would need to ""raise the soil bed"" in order to make it look nice.

I planted moringa seeds right before a week of chilly weather (60s-70s) then read that moringa are difficult to germinate and probably won't if it's less than 80F.

I don't have heating mats or any equipment since I just start everything outside year round, and I have no access to top/back of my fridge. I had the moringa seeds planted in a large (32 oz) yogurt container - I put a ziplock baggie on top of it to keep in moisture and stuck the the whole thing in the oven with the light on. I put a temp gauge in there and discovered that the lightbulb inside my oven keeps it at 92 degrees.

Within 1 day the first seed sprouted, and the 2nd seed sprouted the following day.

2. Walls of water are an alternative also. Unfortunately they're fairly expensive so it probably depends upon how many plants you have and your budget. These act like little greenhouses and the water will keep the internals from freezing down to about 25-26 degrees. I use these and would have had my first round of tomatoes out under these already except for 6 inches of snow and cold temps all week long.

What you're proposing will be fine as long as it doesn't dip below freezing. The toms may show some stress from low overnight temps.

&gt;Pesticides may be either chemical substances or biological agents, and have a broad range of uses. Pesticides are often used to control weeds (**herbicides**), insects (insecticides), and plant diseases (fungicides). Other pesticides registered for use in Minnesota are chemicals not commonly thought of as pest control agents, such as bleach and antimicrobial household sprays used to sanitize surfaces. 

https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/pesticide

&gt;
A pesticide is defined as a chemical agent used to destroy or control pests. The root word is the Latin word “cida” which means to kill. The generic term “pesticides” can apply to a wide spectrum of chemicals, including insecticides, rodenticides, **herbicides**, fungicides, biocides, and similar chemicals.

&gt;Pesticides can be grouped according to the types of pests which they kill:

&gt;Insecticides - insects

They may choose crop choices, planting date adjustments, and crop rotations to limit the emergence and spread of weeds, insects, and funguses. They may use mechanical methods, such as tillage and hoeing by hand, to manage weeds. Some may release beneficial organisms in fields, especially when managing insect pests. They may also apply chemical pesticides, including **herbicides**, insecticides, and fungicides, usually through spraying the fields.

It's possible to look up ""mature size"" on the Internet. What are you growing?

An expensive terracotta pot isn't going to work any better than a cheap terracotta pot. Clay is clay, no matter who made it, or how, or how it's painted or glazed. 

A lot of this is advertising puffery:

&gt;The clay is of high quality, this pot will last the test of time,


What damages clay pots, other than dropping them, is the freezing and thawing of winters. Water molecules inevitably trapped within the porous clay expand with freezing and crack the pot.

So an expensive clay pot isn't necessarily going to be any better at withstanding a severe winter than a cheap one would.

&gt;The high density of the clay makes the pots frost resistant.

Note that they don't specify ""frost proof"" or ""will not crack"".  That's because they can't guarantee that. It's advertising puffery, no more.

If you want pots that you can leave outside all winter long, you're looking at something like a large wooden or concrete planter, not individual pots made of clay or plastic.  

Also, in severe winter areas, you can't leave container plants outdoors anyway, since once the root ball freezes, the wind then sublimates moisture from them, dehydrating and killing the plant.

So plants that need a winter chill period for bloom are protected for the winter in one of two ways. Either you sink the pot in the ground in a sheltered area up to the rim, and then mulch over it with a foot of loose straw.

Or you place the entire pot, once the plant has gone dormant, inside an unheated garage or shed for the duration.",,,1619182280,{},gvk74ct,False,t3_mwt0ox,False,True,t1_gvk3blt,/r/gardening/comments/mwt0ox/would_you_spend_money_on_an_expensive_good/gvk74ct/,1619191217,1,True,False,gardening,t5_2qhkh,,0,[],

It depends on how you're defining ""high quality"". It holds the potting soil and the plant in position the same as a plastic bucket would.  And it can be a very high quality plastic bucket, a good hard-plastic utility bucket, none of your cheap mop pails or  upcycled ice cream tubs.

Frost dates are useful, but they are often misinterpreted. Frequently, when people look for their frost date they find their *average* last frost date. Since it's an average, fully half of years will have frost later than that. Frost *free* dates, on the other hand, mean that 9 out of 10 years you're in the clear, which is much more reliable. 'Course, that still leaves about one year each decade that will fuck you up, and the cold snap last night might have made 2021 that shitty year in a lot of areas. 

Even besides the fact that frost dates are just probabilities, they still leave a lot out when comes to planning when to put plants out. A lot comes down to simply obsessively checking the weather, and the rest is knowing your climate. For instance, my area, Southeastern Pennsylvania, has a similar *average* last frost date as Southern Iowa, but we are a subtropical climate and they are a continental one, which basically means their temperatures vary much more wildly. Sure, Iowa often gets some nice, 70F days in mid-April, but a 50-degree cold snap is not unheard of for them. But here in SEPA, the risk of sub-28F lows is basically over by early March. The low temps we risk by planting on the early side are much more survivable than the late hard freezes that happen sometimes in the Midwest. Last night was about as bad a late cold event as I've seen, but it only got down to 35 when all was said and done.  So someone in Iowa should proceed much more cautiously with regards to cold damage than people in my neck of the woods.",,,1619151446,{},gvj4e5g,False,t3_mwm908,False,False,t3_mwm908,/r/gardening/comments/mwm908/lpt_frost_dates_are_a_joke_dont_trust_them/gvj4e5g/,1619169748,4,True,False,gardening,t5_2qhkh,,0,[],

All this with the caveat that I do not like strawberries from the store AT ALL, so even the more tart everbearing ones are better IMO. 

Really I think everything home grown is so much better. Farmers markets are a second best. Grocery stores are “meh” after growing your own anything.

You take the pit out of an avo, peel the dark skin off carefully (optional, but prevents it rotting into the water. I used the tip of a fine knife and took my time).

Face the flatter (broad) side down, and poke in 3 toothpicks at 45 degrees toward the top of the seed so that with will sit on the rim of a cup and hold the seed a bit below the top of the cup. Fill it up with water to cover about an inch of the seed. It should look like [this](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSHXxGzRoCKNIryedXdqCqrSN1Lqjkq5js98A&amp;usqp=CAU)

Over the first 4 weeks the seed slowly split in two, held together in the middle, and from that middle part a tap root slowly grew down. Once it was about 2 inches long (no stem growth for me at that stage) I moved it to the soil in a very tall pot to give the tap root room. I left just the tip exposed as you can see in my post. 

If you leave it to grow as is, after many years it will fruit and probably taste horrible. I believe 1/50,000 is ""good"". I will cut the whole plant off when the stem is approaching 1cm thick leaving just 15cm of stem sticking out of the soil. Then I will take a cutting of a similar thickness branch of fresh growth from a mature tree of my target type of avo (I like hass) and will do a cleft graft. Once it heals and hopefully takes all future growth will have Hass genetics and as it is a scion from a mature tree it will also fruit years sooner.

This is all in theory, I've never done it before, this is a bit of a hail mary just for fun. I'm going into winter now though so time to buy a small grow light so it doesn't die after all my love I gave it

I had thought the problem was cucumber beetles but I've only seen 5 in my whole garden and never on this plant. I don't know if they do secret night time feeding but I'd think if they caused this much damage to the plant I would have seen some on it at some point.

Now I am thinking it might be a watering issue? I have started watering the plant more often but am kind of confused because the black beauty next to it is thriving with the same watering.
