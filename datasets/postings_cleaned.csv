hiking,if we knew your general area we could recommend some places for you to go experience what typical casual hiking in the is it is not the large expedition style trekking you are referring to
hiking,i hiked that one a couple years ago loved the views
hiking,i think the mind processes some old baggage which is good we distract ourselves too much
hiking,so get a life
hiking,so you are annoying
hiking,i meant there was a practice on the part of descended americans for a long time of not doing prescribed burns on our vast public lands and instead allowing fuel to build americans did even have access to the entire continent until like i do know how they would have managed the land out west in or so when were barely even there plus when it is a wilderness nature should be the one to manage the land not humans
hiking,yeah is there still ice or snow
hiking,happy birthday amazing way to celebrate
hiking,i noticed my mind races when i go hiking about lots of random things i used to be calmer i use the time to refocus and clear my mind focus on my breathing and adjust my posture noticing if my shoulders or jaw is tight or locked maybe some type of meditationy technique will help
hiking,i can relate to that at home i distract myself from negative thoughts now im far from home and alone in a random forrest side thinking about my past old relationships and people i miss all thoses memories are coming up like flashbacks sorrow anger sadness love hate they all came up since this morning
hiking,the climate has chsnged since the dawn of time i do agree we are accelerating it with overpopulation and pollution but there a statistic that of corporations cause of the pollution most modern wild fires are caused by morons starting them intentionally or dumb ass gender reveal parties etc i do my part and do litter and keep my house green as possible but in actuality the climate has always gone through cycles of change controlled burns and people not being morons is a better way to prevent wild fires
hiking,i love this trail did you go to torrey s
hiking,thank you
hiking,thank you dollar store
hiking,we live in a society where respect for our environment has become an afterthought of consumerism no longer intuition or something to live by
hiking,i like your sunglasses
hiking,incredible
hiking,i always end up thinking too much on the trails then i m stuck with those thoughts beside the campfire it s always good to stay ingratiated in the trip itself the what and where and the technical side of the trips too that way you don t tend to loom there in that headspace for long
hiking,the same kind of bros who blast music while hiking for everyone in the area to hear
hiking,i should embrace it as you mentioned
hiking,usually i love longer trips but this time i had this feeling till this morning now it pm and im preparing to sleep maybe the weather was too good my best trips were challenging with lots of rain and wind i know it sounds strange
hiking,instead of showing us amazing views of one of the most striking peaks in the country if not the world you just posted pics or yourself
hiking,it looks like the threads on gas cannister cartridges were standardized until so maybe your stove is at least that old the gigapower was introduced in and i remember it was a big deal because dealing with liquid fuel stoves even small ones like the msr whisperlight was a pain in the ass pump prime light pump some more etc i got my gigapower in and i remember it being so much easier to use
hiking,quite the opposite for me what exactly makes you feel depressed
hiking,i meant there was a practice on the part of descended americans for a long time of not doing prescribed burns on our vast public lands and instead allowing fuel to build this in conjunction with patches of clear cutting and conifer monocultures all that and other things have contributed to the wildfire situation we have today you correct that not all native american practices were sustainable and i never claimed they are a monolith however regular prescribed burning as i understand was somewhat common among most if not all western us tribes not sure about midwest and eastern at any rate that burning which took many forms was combined with seed spreading hunting and horticultural practices to maintain populations over millennia some ecosystems and places with high concentrations of biodiversity may not have existed without those practices
hiking,it s not that scary if you re okay with some exposure there s a chain link to grab for most of the final section the worst part is the crowds and dealing with other hikers who can move quite slowly
hiking,i try to stay in the present open up my senses to capture as much as possible
hiking,this is natural bridges monument in the se corner of utah a really cool little corner that doesn t get explored too often and is a hidden gem
hiking,man do i love an inversion
hiking,oh please this isn t about politics its about people being dumbasses protests aren t occurring in places where parks are being trashed with litter and archeological and culturally significant sites being vandalized i m in wyoming and the surroundings i see it happening to in idaho utah colorado nebraska and the dakotas are not engaged in protests in the remote areas of natural beauty it s people not how to conduct themselves while camping or spending time in nature the dumbass climber in utah who secured bolts on a petroglyph wall in moab wasn t protesting
hiking,towards the end i start feeling sad that it s going to be over soon
hiking,i use darn tough i have the athletic kind thinner than the regular hiking ones for when it s hot avoid cotton they retain sweat and will lead to blisters
hiking,i ll check them out thanks
hiking,if it snows where you are and you want to buy something for four seasons then boots make sense if not then shoes are usually a good call it really comes down to fit if you going to be in wet areas i take a look at oboz best sole in all conditions i worn and really comfortable salomon has some really specific for different conditions too they can get pricey but if you not buying in a store the online gear sites are filled with last years model and you can save a lot just remember that fit and comfort is what it about and in a lot of cases you do get what you pay for
hiking,i really liked rei light weight coolmax socks
hiking,i havent been yet trips booked for july but everybody says the scariest part now is the crowds not so much the hike i read the hike is very doable but crowds have gotten so big you have to hug the wall for large groups to pass etc it was going to be one of our hikes but i not hugging the wall ft up lol to wide for that
hiking,darn tough
hiking,i regret not driving the extra miles to go by whitney i went up the to olancha by accident missing a previous turn it was a great miss though driving right along the mountains was beautiful it was super windy though felt like our car was going to get blown off the road
hiking,is it as scary as they say it is
hiking,congrats very nice
hiking,removed
hiking,shid i dont remember commenting that tbh
hiking,i celebrated my in zion as well no where i d rather be honestly
hiking,can i ask which phone or camera
hiking,i second this took a roadtrip through utah on our way to the grand canyon and was amazed at how vast and beautiful the terrain is bryce and zion were the first stops
hiking,this looks epic how was it
hiking,heh depends on the mountains if it up on mt victoria or robson or even parts of the trail on temple i say boots can be snow you need to kick steps in can be lots of deep scree that would be bad even in mid lows i prefer trail runners and low boots like moabs but not for canadian rockies off trail stuff it not ankle support boots do help that much until you get to plastics or ski boots it having a stiffer sole for rocky bits the ability to do a bit of edging in scrambling situations the ability to traverse snow and kick steps and the ability to keep scree out so like light mountaineering boots say but if just on a trail there with no snow then approach shoes and trail runners work great
hiking,it not easy to see even from lone pine as much of it is hidden by nearby peaks and ridges and not that impressive to be honest it set back among high stuff so you have to be kind of due east to see it although maybe from some peaks in the southern inyos it would be more visible if you play around with google maps in view you notice the problem pretty quickly
hiking,please don t feed wildlife read up on leave no trace especially the section on how to treat wildlife but people will say oh it s just one bird but that habit sticks and there are repercussions if you ve put this on your social media please take it down or at least use it as a learning moment and say why you shouldn t feed wildlife so others don t imitate
hiking,yup i was just telling someone else in the comments that i didn t jump over to the peak next to it cause my wife was waiting at wind started to pick up and so did the clouds weather definitely changes in a heartbeat up there
hiking,go to your local rei or other gear shop tell them what you want to do they will help you out
hiking,thank you
hiking,there are organizations that do guided hiking trips here one such at the cheaper end this too here a commercial outfitter that does it you probably saw this more expensive local universities and colleges often have similar outings and often they are open to
hiking,if you have one go up your local rei ask anyone there and they should be able to help in your area if you don t have an rei there may be other local gear shops otherwise hiking doesn t have to be a multi activity you can just go to the closest state park find a trail and start walking only gear you need is your feet not having transportation makes that difficult again talking with a local gear shop should get you some ideas maybe even an offer to go out
hiking,this massively depends on your i for instance have challenges with my feet and i love the support for both foot and ankle that i get from my hiking boots when carrying overnighting gear my boots happen to be meinld island pro gtx then again for many sorts of daytrips even my feet can deal with the situation with my trail running shoes and actual trail running is something i never do because of connective tissue and joint problems
hiking,i just use costco low gym socks your shoes are gon na full with sand pretty quick so pack a few extra pairs for each hike
hiking,yeah i looked into olancha as a place i may have been able to see it but you just gave me confirmation that s not the case if only there were more than hours in a day i last saw whitney over years ago i hope to see it again soon
hiking,go early and bring sunscreen and i say that as someone who never wears sunscreen lol
hiking,happy i need to make it out there one day
hiking,injinji liner and merino wool socks just thin do not wear waterproof shoes

hiking,if you download the app alltrails you can search paths near you you can sort by difficulty mileage loop or point to point trails and see pictures other people have taken it uses your phone gps to guide you along unfamiliar trails too if you pay for the subscription you can download the maps so they work without cell reception as long as you have reception the free version works great though
hiking,there a climbers trail that the approach for the east ridge climb for pinnacle
hiking,i felt i was in a different world when i was there really beautiful did get to do the narrows hopefully someday happy birthday
hiking,please dont feed the wildlife
hiking,oh right forgot everyone on reddit thinks only the people on the other side of the political spectrum do anything wrong
hiking,where are these places i ve hiked my evans curious abt the other spots
hiking,thank you
hiking,whats up
hiking,got it
hiking,haha thanks
hiking,thank you
hiking,thanks and yeah i agree this was very fun
hiking,hidden lake up at north cascade np has been on my bucket list for exactly this idea if you haven t been there yet highly recommend
hiking,awesome yeah i recall a pretty brutal uphill after the footbridge nice to do less traveled trails
hiking,wow great place to celebrate beautiful
hiking,psa it is generally bad practice to feed wildlife especially for a photo op
hiking,life uh finds a way
hiking,nice i ll be there in july can t wait
hiking,it really is so much beauty i m lucky that i live hours away so i m always taking trips there
hiking,it really is one of my favorite places in the world
hiking,yes it s open we went in afternoon and it wasn t as crowded
hiking,love that trail
hiking,one of my favorite spots in northeast tennessee
hiking,best to stay away from coton and heavy clothing they weigh you down absorb moisture dry slowly and aren t as efficient at keeping you warm when opt instead for synthetic fibers and lightweight wool merino always best to have multiple light layers so you can adjust as your body heats up i always hike with a thin wind rain shell unless there is zero chance of weather and it s a short hike a merino wool and then mix in a synthetic long sleeve base layer and a micro fleece as needed based on weather always wool socks and synthetic pants
hiking,i need to get out to utah this looks unreal
hiking,the main trails in most us national parks are very popular well signed and well maintained many times there are even paved for the first mile or if you made it from india to the us on your own you can make it to the main attractions in yellowstone grand canyon most of the guided groups i see when i visit us national parks are international tours on a big bus doing quick stops at main attractions moving quickly through the park and staying in hotels the green tortoise is a cheaper one that camps i think trips like you did in the himalayas will be very expensive in the us you can find some through rei or nols
hiking,yes i had some nuts
hiking,thanks this looks like a good resource i would look more into other blogs and all for planning my own trips i definitely want to get this fear out of managing things on my own with smaller trips and maybe go on one or two guided ones for the really good ones that would be more enjoyable as well as being
hiking,yes i loved it in had lunch at the look out my goal is to try to camp out at most of the fire lookouts
hiking,damn just hiked this and posted here as well and your picture puts mine to shame
hiking,i took the historic route there wasnt too much snow didn t need spikes and we had the entire summit to ourselves only one group of backpackers the whole day other than the falls trail which was packed on the way back down the falls trail connects to the el cap trail
hiking,yes a few days ago
hiking,ok i love the idea of hiking but i always been a little unsure of what to wear what should one wear on a hike like this
hiking,they reopened the upper hike i was there last year but part of it was blocked off from damage to the trail
hiking,there are facebook group for most states named like california they could answer you more specifically trails here are usually pretty easy to follow a guide is not really needed you should get some used gear and go for some small trip like days to get used to it have fun
hiking,my favorite hike in wa
hiking,i live in the midwest and just got a pair of trail runners hoka speed goats they do really good for state parks that inckude rock bed they left high enough off the ground so stepping in shallow creeks your foot will still be above water level and not get wet or inches i paired with wool socks and they dried pretty quick when i got them wet if that your concern or get the gore tex version
hiking,that cat is living the life
hiking,thanks for the advice yeah i would definitely look into exploring the local trails as well i am not really bothered about the difficulty of the actual trail i have some experience even in very harsh mountainous climbs i am more worried about the logistics managing all the other aspects of the hike on my own like setting up camp cooking materials etc as i have never done that before i guess i could start small and try to get more familiar with these things on my own
hiking,happy birthday nice choice for celebrating
hiking,their culture has nothing to do with it and not all native american tribes did it they were not a monolith in fact in the western part of the us native americans would drive hundreds of buffalos off cliffs they killed more than they needed and many went to rot in the northeast natives burned entire forests to force out elk for hunting
hiking,not op but i would if i could
hiking,yes if you are not a used to the altitude i came from boston and went straight up for the hike yikes was an issue but otherwise if you can deal with the altitude and are fit enough enjoy the walk and views
hiking,this is true and i sorry that my post made it sound like that however its use was drastically reduced to the mass casualties and loss of land experienced by native people and a long culture of demonizing fire by private land owners and public land managers not from those cultures that is now changing
hiking,haha yes she s definitely a explorer
hiking,amazing hike did it two days in a row before
hiking,i love that your kid has charcoal all over their face truly getting in touch with nature haha
hiking,i recommend a pair of waterproof trail runners from a brand like merrell keen altra or scarpa head to your local rei and try some out edit and do forget some good trail socks like darn tough or smartwool they slightly padded so you want to wear them when you choosing shoes to make sure you get the right fit
hiking,i believe this was just off thing valley road heading south
hiking,no problem my man my wife snd i are avid peak baggers and have summited a few along trails in our life times proud of you keep going
hiking,awesome thanks for the info
hiking,yes last week the lake you can fish year around and most creeks and rivers open this saturday for trout fishing i recommend this hike not hard and plenty of views and some goods spots to fish also there is to much snow the trail is the spaulding lake trail via fuller lake if you do feel like hiking you can fish at fuller lake oh also spaulding lakes main recreation area is closed this is the backside good luck and have fun
hiking,it is so beautiful out there the sky is endless
hiking,people really really suck sometimes i noticed a ton of tagging on boulders and trees as well as tons of shattered glass and beer cans around creeks and waterfall areas then if you say something to someone hey man can you please make sure you pick that up kids play around here you get shitty looks and faux tough guy attitude seriously if you cant pick up after yourself stay home amirite
hiking,that s butifule
hiking,kitty
hiking,yeah that does look similar but i do think mine would fit that canister since the male threading is on the stove itself this stove is thought to have belonged to my grandfather many years ago so it probably is a knockoff but instead an old design
hiking,how was the jerky
hiking,parks should require a lnt training before you allowed entry people clearly passed on home training it just basic decency
hiking,one of the big causes of people losing their homes is because they build in zones that are known to be wildfire prone im not saying thats everyone that loses their home to wildfires but if humans learned to live with nature and not on top of nature everyone would be better off same goes to developers that continue to build in the flood plain just to make a quick buck
hiking,beautiful pictures did the bird take off from your hand
hiking,oh well guess i missed it
hiking,and we got stuck in a thunderstorm coming down saw bolt of lightening hit side of cliff i was so distraught left my boots at trailhead had to rush down through thunder and snow went back in september and it was perfect conditions
hiking,and yes i did angels landing and it was lovey
hiking,the river canyon was the narrows it was probably too cold or frozen in december but you can rent the gear i was wearing a waders suit waterproof socks and shoes for and it helps
hiking,good job man
hiking,nope was just reminiscing and forgot i was part of this group so i decided to share
hiking,this was recent right
hiking,that my plan as well lol
hiking,that s so rad thanks for sharing
hiking,was that recent is fishing open there we ve been looking for something to do this weekend from reno
hiking,as long as you are willing to pay a few hundred dollars you can get a guide exactly like you describing for any national park and many state parks prices vary by location for a day trip through yellowstone for example this company offers trips for that what i would consider reasonable for a area trips may be closer to the company above includes all tge you need into the cost if you go with one that does places like rei will rent you gear and other sites too that you can google for your area also check blogs and reddit for info it easy with all this info available to plan your own trips and save up for guided tours of really gorgeous or remote areas good luck
hiking,this civilization is going down at high speed when we have no choice but to put such signs very sad
hiking,right most of them nearby were it was eerily beautiful
hiking,one of actually probably my all time favorite state
hiking,interesting usually trails with burns like that are closed for a while seems like a cool hike to see fresh burn
hiking,where was the river canyons i went there few years ago and i didn t know they existed however it was december did you go up angels landing
hiking,the signage at this trail said it was technically open but unmaintained
hiking,jesus really i can t even imagine that s crazy
hiking,my wife is pregnant too but i know this isn t the last time i ll be doing this having kids ain t the end all your fun the way i think about it is if i act as good as possible around the wife for some time she will let me go out and play
hiking,nice looks great
hiking,i did this in may one year and the snow was waist deep in some places
hiking,just had a kid so kind of waiting to see if it will even be happening
hiking,i didn t prepare at all for it to be honest i just googled beginner and picked this and hiked right up turns out there are no easy it was a challenge but i was committed and wasn t stopping until i reached the top no matter how long it took me i would suggest you start off really early in the morning and to check the weather up to the day of pack tons of water and snacks take many breaks if needed it s not a race but a personal achievement wish you the best hope you get to see the amazing view
hiking,snow lake in washington
hiking,i thinking about trying this in june but do feel prepared at all how tough was it
hiking,maybe after he was hit by a truck
hiking,is this trail currently closed
hiking,perhaps the best entry level hike in the whites great scrambles
hiking,congratulations
hiking,awesome are you training any to prepare or are you just going with the flow
hiking,new hampshire might be my favorite place in the world
hiking,wow for reals man that makes me even happier that i hiked this i m definitely happy of having this hike under my belt i appreciate the information
hiking,i stayed at zion ponderosa ranch resort on the east side of the park and it has great camping and glamping sites to pick from there s a ton of activities and it s nicely managed it s about a minute drive through the park to the visitor center but the ride is super pleasant there s also some campgrounds around the visitor center but i m not sure how to go about getting one of those i recommend calling the park they are super helpful and i know you ve heard this but go super early for everything earliest shuttle earliest parking earliest dinner crowds are killer but you can plan around them the parking lot fills up around and the only other places to park are a day in town some other the park pass is for day access the narrows and angels landing will get crowded but they are so worth it the other hikes are hit or miss i m doing deer trap and cable mountain today so i ll report back outside of the park and springdale there s nothing seriously it s empty but as for other hikes things to do check out lake powell antelope canyon in arizona or bryce canyon have fun
hiking,september forgot i was on this group and decided to post last night while i was reminiscing
hiking,national parks are great and you should definitely plan to visit them but don t discount the stuff that s close to you getting started can be difficult and state parks typically have and trails that are easy to on additionally you might be surprised by the beauty they have to offer they also typically have cheap or free campgrounds available so while it is advisable to find partners through forums like this one or local clubs it is possible to get started on your own in less rugged terrain near you btw i m also in the midwest and would be down to help as i m looking to get back into backpacking if you re anywhere near feel free to pm me and we might be able to link up
hiking,thanks yes i m so proud of myself and it s definitely something i want to continue doing you re absolutely right it s addicting
hiking,i think we got pretty lucky not at lot of people made it to the top
hiking,i wish my wife was waiting at and it was starting to get late and clouds were starting to form so decided to play it safe
hiking,quite
hiking,it was definitely a life experience i m looking forward to doing it again
hiking,it was my very first time trying a do people prep for this
hiking,i was there monday and was actually surprised that it was super crowded it a beautiful and majestical place and you captured some great shots
hiking,i forgot i was on this group and forgot to post this was from back in september if i m not mistaking thought i d share since i was going through my pics last night
hiking,its horrible seeing the loss but its nature but the increasing rate at which these forests are burning down and the sheer scale is an outcome of climate change the question is whether the erormity of these fires is doing more damage than the ecosystem could ordinarily recover from just speculating i no expert
hiking,lol some flex and comfortable gap khakis columbia sweater and columbia waterproof jacket man this was my very first i had been looking at weather forecast and reading how much stuff changed depending on elevation so i had to be this prepared my first and didn t know what to expect
hiking,just got married at the temple of sinawava a few weeks ago already wishing i could go back great pics
hiking,saw a lot worse than that visiting the otherwise beautiful river canyons in the foothills just east of the san joaquin valley oakhurst on down large river boulders completely covered with paint rock faces marred with graffiti piles of garbage dumped cigarette butts discarded in dry grass smoldering barbecue charcoal just dumped wouldn t return to such blight what kind of human cockroaches would so despise and deface such natural beauty are they ever held to account there are still parts of the west where locals wouldn t tolerate this being done to their public lands
hiking,as of right now the crowd was manageable but i can definitely see it getting terribly crowded in a few weeks try to aim for a week that kids are in school if possible and that will help i know this is the most common advice given but it s so get there early the free parking at zion visitor center fills up pretty much immediately so plan to get there at otherwise parking in town is a day also the shuttle tickets are tricky to get but you can also bike into the park if you can t get one they have to rent that are super fun
hiking,welcome to the club it s addicting
hiking,where are the other hundred hikers lucky to have that summit so uncrowded weekday
hiking,i ll tell you who rapscallions
hiking,at the beginning it was definitely crowded but after about miles the majority of people turned around and there were only a few other couples and single hikers that spaced out pretty nicely i was pleasantly surprised the narrows is usually closed this week of the year so maybe there were less people than usual we got super lucky
hiking,crispi boots the best i ve found
hiking,is ok thats about what i expected well i super cheap so ya know
hiking,that trail never gets old
hiking,thanks this looks kinda like what i had in mind is ok thats about what i expected the timberlands were all between there and too
hiking,it actually really super cold here most of us hate it wink wink
hiking,i hoping to do mine this year congrats
hiking,i ve seen people hiking grays and torreys in flip flops it s close enough to denver that anything goes i m not condoning this btw

hiking,if you don t mind me asking did you grow up there my wife and i are looking at moving to colorado but we wanted to get some first hand perspectives on what schools and stuff are like as we both want to be teachers and all of that
hiking,hoka speedgoats
hiking,gorgeous pics i was there with my daughter last summer and it did not disappoint
hiking,you didn t take the short cut
hiking,i like merrell but they are inexpensive you looking at but if you serious about hiking there anything many things more important than footwear many people prefer the high ones with ankle support try going to an outdoor store and seeing what feels right and good to you good luck
hiking,oh man i m jealous pretty pic this looks so peaceful
hiking,congrats i did my first last year incredible time
hiking,bonk
hiking,yep before european contact native americans used fire constantly as a tool to actively manage the land using fire to manage the land never went away
hiking,your friend is a great photographer
hiking,miles is km
hiking,i don t think so i was driving up to death valley last month on the and was wondering if i d see it turned off on the in olancha about miles south of lone pine and never saw whitney it s a really pretty drive though
hiking,yep before european contact native americans used fire constantly as a tool to actively manage the land a lot of biodiversity and open habitat exists because of tens of thousands of years of such management controlled burning is a huge part of the landscape in the western us and i glad we starting to it once again wildfires that reach up into the crowns of trees and cover millions of acres should be rare not an occurrence controlled burning can get us back to that being a rarity especially with various tribe members sharing their knowledge
hiking,stunning picture
hiking,wow i know it not the point but i love your hiking fit
hiking,burning off the deadwood is essential in forests this picture made me tremendously happy this morning thank you
hiking,road approaching neversink river area in foothills of the catskills in rural sullivan county ny this is a special trout river you can barely get at it in fact it where fly fishing was invented you can not casually drive to this place it a full two hours from nyc and you need gps to even hope to find it the hillside in the woods approaching a state parking lot was absolutely buried in garbage it looked like a brazilian favela or the kind of squalor that they put on tv when asking you to donate money the drainage ditch was full of diapers soaking up runoff water and there were plastic water bottles and cheap fast food containers everywhere like styrofoam clamshells stuff that hikers do use and it about miles from any real source look deeper into the woods and there is garbage absolutely everywhere people are far too kind when trying to describe what been happening the ghetto has been coming to the countryside and shitting all over it just like they do in the ghetto that why it a ghetto it not the streets it the people in them
hiking,it totally not that bad we have over days of sunshine here and the cold is dry instead of humid and bone chilling our snow is like snow globe snow light and fluffy
hiking,that s what i think it is just wish i could tell where to go once the trail officially ends
hiking,is pic from telluride up by bridal veil falls such a wonderful place
hiking,stop making things up to have a reason to hate somebody it only leads to a rather depressing life
hiking,totally awesome park beautiful photo
hiking,looks film
hiking,oh man i love that hike
hiking,or right because vandals that are encouraged to vandalized because of their oppressed status would never vandalize more
hiking,oh right sorry i forgot that a protected class that can do no wrong
hiking,where is this
hiking,its not even shitty honestly i did some time as a wildland fire fighter for the us forest service and honestly the vast majority of wildfires i got called out on could have easily been prevented by controlled burns the reason people lose homes is because people think fire is big bad and scary its a beautiful natural process that can be contained by proper sure there were random freak fires from lightning and such but really controlled burns would help a lot in ways most people do even think of
hiking,exactly it horrible seeing the loss but its nature after the australian wildfires they said some species of plants that were laying dorment for years sprouted after the fires shitty as it is its the circle of life
hiking,damn you hella cute
hiking,no just no
hiking,most people do realize that wildfires need to happen in order to replenish the land in fact some species like the ponderosa pine ca propagate unless their cones are subjected to something like i love visiting burn scars and seeing the vegetation coming back the shoots the grasses the mosses even the weeds
hiking,did you hike that in jeans and that jacket im not criticizing i never look this fresh on a summit
hiking,good idea just shared there too thanks
hiking,congratulations on your achievement that peak gives you several notches on your belt that is the highest peak on the continental divide and the continental divide trail which in montana crosses triple divide pass where water flows either to the pacific the atlantic or the arctic oceans as well as the highest in the front range congratulations on a noble quest stay safe and stay well if i am lucky enough i might see you on the trail some day see you at the top
hiking,your post was removed due to your account being new please wait until your account is day old before you post again or try messaging the moderators for approval i am a bot and this action was performed automatically please contact the moderators of this subreddit hiking if you have any questions or concerns
hiking,probably not
hiking,i noticed so much of that shit recently during covid people who normally would ever visit wild places are suddenly going to them and they have no idea how to behave in or respect where they are it like it just another blank slate for them to defile and despoil i was hiking the franconia ridge trail last summer in the white mountains of new hampshire and i could believe all of the trash graffiti and the impromptu toilets with toilet paper all over the place i had hiked that trail so many times before and i had never seen anything like it it made me so sad and angry i hear you
hiking,nice eye i guess op didn t say i just
hiking,how hard did you have to try to make it seem like you were the only ones at the narrows
hiking,planning a trip soon any tips how was the crowd
hiking,date on the sign says
hiking,man i wish it was summer already and the snow has melted beautiful
hiking,mosses would probably enjoy this
hiking,i guess i m moving to colorado
hiking,thank you i m all self taught and very new into photography so this means a lot to me
hiking,thank you hopefully one day you ll get the see them again
hiking,i traveled to over countries and am not from the us so i not biased but i tend to agree especially utah is extremely unique those kind of rock formations and scenery in the national parks there are very unique and stunning
hiking,i love this place visited in
hiking,that s what i m saying haha
hiking,was this recent nice
hiking,looks so peaceful
hiking,you be fine that being said if you using new gear i would do a single overnighter first with a plan to get back to civilization for any adjustments but you survive regardless even if you do if you really worried about it get a garmin inreach for emergencies
hiking,it chris hemsworth skinnier long lost cousin
hiking,just amazing what a fulfilling view after a good hike
hiking,did you camp there planning a trip in may but having trouble their online site
hiking,was this recent where s the snow
hiking,mount evans is where my wife and i camped when i had to cut our drive short by hours because yall weed be hitting different than what i used to it worked out as that one of our favorite places in the world
hiking,i live in sd what trail is this what part of the pct it s magical
hiking,wonder what it looked like years ago bet there was a lot more snowpack at this time of year
hiking,awesome place to spend a week
hiking,ah i love recognizing specific locations on here i used to leave up near the
hiking,oh for heavens sake i can not understand who thinks it s fun to spray paint a park i love graffiti art but not there do it on a wall made for graffiti art
hiking,holy saturation batman
hiking,depending on what you are doing it not just walking as someone suggested plenty of things to consider spend some time researching and prepping get on youtube and watch some folks vlogs about what they do for cooking water a weekend trip not far from a town with cars nearby is different that a possible isolated scenario where no one knows where you are or when to expect you where is your next meal coming from next clean water how much water are you going to carry on you food safety have an emergency plan if you get an injury like a phone is there service there or have a garmin you can prep within a month but you do need to prep
hiking,beautiful part of san diego hard to beat the view of from pct on mt laguna
hiking,spectacular photos i had no idea colorado looked like this
hiking,looks like it be a scramble a ways off trail
hiking,is observation point still closed from rock fall
hiking,tahoe rim trail plus part of the pct they are same thing for a lil bit
hiking,people who do stuff like that and scatter trash ruin it for everyone else when it gets so bad places get closed to the public
hiking,hey thanks for responding i m coming from orange county and would be going up on the north i believe that takes you to right so i m hoping there s somewhere closer from lone pine where i can still see mount whitney clearly
hiking,hate when they do it at the beach
hiking,where roughly are you coming from
hiking,locations for and moved out to co last month and can t wait for the warm weather settle in
hiking,which trail did you take
hiking,you should have posted this on the
hiking,thank you i did the pinnacle trail last summer but it stopped before i saw any tarn i wonder if you have to make it up a scramble to get to there
hiking,thank you for your help
hiking,i only wear boots after fucking up my ankles one too many times which was immediately after buying hiking shoes instead of boots near permanent damage has turned me off of having no ankle support if you smart enough to avoid fucking yourself up shoes are just fine
hiking,i sadly haven t been back to colorado since i was a child but i remember those blue lakes so distinctly you ve taken such lovely photos
hiking,is this recent
hiking,miss colorado gorgeous place
hiking,gorgeous gorges
hiking,where are all these taken if you remember especially
hiking,i wonder if this might be a little tarn at the base of pinnacle glacier maybe a bushwhack from the pinnacle peak trail to my eyes that appears to be the south face of rainier the nisqually glacier right in front of the person maybe anvil rock just at the right edge of the frame
hiking,wow those are some of the most beautiful shots i ve ever seen almost unreal looking surreal
hiking,wow looks amazing
hiking,my biggest concern if i were you would be planning the resupplies i done week long trips but i never done anything long enough to need a resupply it not something that would worry me much though otherwise from a planning and preparing standpoint i feel comfortable in your shoes doing this trip plan exit strategies make sure people know where you are all that normal stuff you should do on a shorter trip anyway the above assumes your previous experience was similar to what this trip will be meaning you planned or helped plan the trip you carried all your gear with you etc i only say that because some boy scout groups only ever hike to lodges and other such places where they only need to carry clothes and snacks but can leave the sleep system and full meals at home that a very different kind of trip
hiking,the lighting in your pics is fabulous
hiking,indeed it has ski slopes around me did do so hot this winter
hiking,this is before everything catches fire in july for months but yes it s otherworldly out here
hiking,my husband and i use the half dome he carries it so i can t speak to the weight i know there are lighter ones out there but the size works for us we usually store our packs outside of the tent under the rain tarp he s i m
hiking,it has been a bad year for snow
hiking,colorado
hiking,i ll tell my brother he did good lol
hiking,beautiful where at in the sierras
hiking,my kid and i used this yodo lightweight person camping backpacking tent with carry bag blue for a day hike last year i m he s and skinny we had our packs with us but it was very tight we were only in the tent together to sleep if you can deal with that then it is a good choice if not i agree w the other posts that you should look for a tent
hiking,oh good idea about the outline thanks
hiking,yeah i bought msr twice and the was a while back and i ca recall the model but the one that replaced it is elixir which is what i have for the reasoning was did want to spend too much had to have two vestibules for keeping gear the floor area was the largest compared to all others i am wife is we found it roomy in the with that said the rei quarter dome would be my next choice
hiking,alamere falls down there
hiking,cool i have been up to the white mountains myself but i know that snow can last up there til summer
hiking,ooh la la that sounds amazing wishing you two all the best
hiking,if you done overnights and feel comfortable there no reason it wo be the same just a whole lot more of it and every day in terms of getting in shape you wo be the same hiker when you end that you were when you started where you head is at is going to be the make or break just roll with what presented and you be good to go
hiking,thank you we re horseback riding in garden of the gods and then we ve got a couple hikes mapped out to do i m beyond stoked we re coming from florida so the cooler weather will be a nice change haha
hiking,not thru hiking but had some great conversations with those who are
hiking,congratulations i hope you two have a wonderful honeymoon here
hiking,blue lakes in silverton
hiking,eldorado canyon and dream lake respectively
hiking,it s a whole other world
hiking,thank you i actually started an etsy shop awhile back for these that i m gon na open up again in the next month
hiking,no they re from last the mountains are still covered in snow currently but should be melted by june for rmnp hmmm i d probably check out the of glass if you re trying for a longer hike glacier gorge is also great for a little shorter hike
hiking,looks like a knockoff of the snow peak gigapower
hiking,i m sure that if the human species had never lived on earth if we had been martians for as long as we ve been around we would look at earth and declare it to be heaven we d send rovers and submarines over in rockets so that we can explore the most beautifully intricate place in the solar system but we didn t we ve familiarised ourselves with this magical place and now we re killing it happy earth day
hiking,i have a nemo hornet just to give reference i am but i ca even fit my pack inside my tent much less another person i would lay out the dimensions of your choices on the ground and try and get your stuff in the outline i think using a for people plus packs is unrealistic
hiking,for and gear you will want a tent a without gear will be tight for
hiking,in the end it s all just walking take your time use your brain listen to your body and go walk
hiking,as someone who it last year i would describe it as timid it is relatively short but it actually has more elevation change per mile than the continental divide trail which cuts through the rockies that being said you should definitely go for it it a once in a life time experience and most people struggle to find the time with work my best tip for new is you do need all the shit you think you need get that pack weight down
hiking,adventure cat
hiking,i love seeing all he created let s give praise to the creator god
hiking,love this hike relatively easy and quick to a beautiful place going to the upper lake however kicked my ass
hiking,well get a good pair of shoes or boots because you going to depend on them about as much as anything i have put some miles on my hokas but not with a heavy pack also start planning on what type of food your going to carry and how often you are able to restock along the trail account time for going into towns if necessary you gon na hurt after a few days but it should go away baring any physical problems you might have just be careful and listen to your body have a bail out plan
hiking,get the guide book it excellent once you have the hang of signage and as long as you pay attention you be fine there are some somewhat challenging climbs and some areas where other state park trails and such spin off so it really easy to get off the main trail if you are paying attention or miss a junction my mom did a thru hike of this when she turned and is not something who i say was in terrific shape not bad shape but she not naturally a physically active person and she did just fine once she had the right equipment despite how nice spring can be though the climate around superior can vary so much one day it be the next day with heavy dense frigid fog rolling off the lake so you have to prepare for quite a variety of weather conditions even in july it can be that way lived in duluth many years but you probably already realize that if you live fairly close i love visiting duluth but i hated living there despite loving the lake the weather is just far too tempermental for me i used to leave town frequently because all around duluth it would be sunny and in the and then it would be in the city thanks to the lake and fog i was prepared for it when i moved there though i grew up in ne mn and spent plenty of time near the lake
hiking,damn that s gorgeous
hiking,we re going to colorado for our honeymoon in two weeks i ve been once before but my husband hasn t i m so excited to go back
hiking,made an edit for a secondary location it may be hopefully you can find the place
hiking,looks like it s near st andrews area maybe this is west side slope i believe so that is my best guess edit could also be tokaloo rock
hiking,one of my favorite states i bear the freezing cold to live in this amazing landscape
hiking,always good to go hiking with a loyal companion
hiking,i love the light in the second and last one i m up in the rockies in wyoming and the view is so pretty mountains make me happy
hiking,thank you so much i have a couple prints currently on my wall right now of other places in the sierras i have visited
hiking,breathtakingly beautiful you could easily frame those and have gorgeous pieces of art
hiking,you shouldn t make assumptions about other people i m disabled needed a break and i saw it by my car picked it up to take a pic while i rested put it back when i got back out to go get a couple more photos it stayed there please don t make assumptions about others it only takes a couple seconds to ask first
hiking,where is the first one
hiking,gorgeous
hiking,where are the last two
hiking,pic almost look like hawaii got to plan more weekend trips to the part of the state
hiking,you should be taking souvenirs from nature
hiking,do you take your cat everywhere with you
hiking,i stumbled across it while backpacking in the hoover wilderness this past summer i want to go back
hiking,i love the picture of the mountain beach that s a place i could spend quite a while
hiking,i might be biased because i ve only left the states a few times but colorado and utah have to be two of the most otherworldly places on the planet just have to stop and stare every time i travel to that area
hiking,wow beautiful pictures they could all be post cards
hiking,okay
hiking,it is not it will open in late may or june typically depending on snow pack
hiking,i is glacier open right now
hiking,take only pictures leave only footprints
hiking,also some bonus picks of a trip i guided at glacier point
hiking,i m about to eat dinner so i didn t read all the comments and i hope you can just tell me quickly where in colorado is this i just got back from there a few weeks ago and am going back in september hopefully and i want to see that place specifically the sixth picture
hiking,wonderful pics they recent i m visiting to go for some hiking in the rockies at the beginning of june any suggestions
hiking,so nice i spent a week there and mt sneffels with a buddy a while back by far my most memorable trip
hiking,you might want to check out oboz they comfortable and the soles on most of their stuff is firm and crazy sticky best soles i worn and salomons for boots might be another good luck with the search
hiking,i there many years ago
hiking,yes so in order from first pic to last blue lakes rifle reservoir telluride blue lakes blue lakes ice lake basin ice lake basin ridgway off the highway i do remember where exactly black canyon of the gunnison rmnp do remember where exactly hanging lake mt bierdstadt red rock canyon maroon bells mary glacier eldorado canyon eldorado canyon and rmnp dream lake trail
hiking,i mean pikes place market is pretty cool lots of vendors and little stores i always have fun i am particularly fond if mt rainier ive lived in the area for a few years now and i tracked down a few cool trails that people tend to overlook a couple even have dispersed camping on the trail or near by
hiking,upvoted because your photo shows the actual colors of the rocks in that area not the colors we see posted here every week
hiking,i have done that short little hike many times it a beautiful view
hiking,yes
hiking,aha i fully agree with you
hiking,these are great
hiking,greeter falls
hiking,dope spot
hiking,location
hiking,oh man i m a coloradan too and some of these photos caught my eye would u be so kind to list the locations
hiking,are some of those from blue lakes
hiking,san juans are the most beautiful mountains in the world do me
hiking,wow this is awesome nice catch
hiking,yeah i dislike feeling rocks through my sole i like the keen hiking shoes i have but was looking through things that might be worth investing in for better hiking comfort and thought maybe boots thanks for your thoughts
hiking,america is so awesome
hiking,congrats i went to the first platform to view the falls anything further down does have a good view from the top there are too many trees in the way there x space to do the deed on that platform you just have to get down a whole lot of steps first best wishes
hiking,no need to worry about downvotes i m vegan too
hiking,or if you really like to make an impact try going vegan or at the least vegetarian downvoting me does lessen the impact of animal agriculture as much as you like
hiking,my feeling is that boots are more about being in the snow crossing shallow streams without gaiters and keeping rocks out there a lot of shoes that have similar like the oboz bridgers if you carrying some weight or are going to be spending a lot of time on rock a lot of people immediately say trail runners but while i have some i not in that camp comfortable light but limiting and i personally like a firm sole where i not feeling every rock so if four seasons is a big deal i would worry too much about the ankle support element shoes should be fine
hiking,few inches here and there
hiking,thank you for your advice
hiking,switching from hiking boots to trail runners was the best gear upgrade i have made
hiking,ahh i did see a continental divide sign now that yall mentioned it makes sense now but yes i see them or four per group over the last week hundreds of them if you add them all up thank you all
hiking,hijacking top comment while i m super grateful for the awards from y all please consider donating to charities like the conservation colorado education fund instead they do some incredible work and could use the money more than reddit
hiking,i like new balance and brooks new balance makes good trail running sneakers too if you want to try something in between
hiking,yes ice lake basin and blue lakes

hiking,like years ago i got offered a job in denver and one in nyc i took the nyc job and was able to find a fiancee and have an overall great life but at what cost it a hour drive to any decent mountain and they cap out at feet man i yearn for the mountains
hiking,yay sa this from the stellies side

hiking,nothing like alpine lakes imo yup you get all kinds of blue and green water
hiking,continental divide trail runs right through there part of the trail probably follows the road for a bit
hiking,i believe there a chunk of the cdt continental divide trail trial there most likely folk walking that north bound

hiking,i ve been amazed by colorado before and it never ceases doing that it s an incredible place i wish to visit someday

hiking,yep from the overlook
hiking,of course you do need a pyramide when you have a metal ring in the right size and good ventilation
hiking,beep boop i a robot here a copy of pollyanna was i a good bot info more books

hiking,not a problem i just show a very easy way many people build pyramids for example carve knitting needles and make it more complicated than it needs to be
hiking,just an easy way to make a fire that what i meant under the shown conditions anyone could start a fire or am i too optimistic in sweden at least firewood is very often missing at the fire sites but having dry trees and the tools you carried that not exactly a problem nevermind cute video
hiking,and if you put on more kindling the thinnest twigs then no ax is needed either
hiking,yep
hiking,not horrendous there were about three stages first mile and a half was wonderful weather was perfect legs were fresh trail wasn t steep stage two started about two miles in where i put my spikes on due to the snow mud general calamity that lasted until right after the tree line on little haystack stage three was holy crap where did all this wind come from i just fell all the way to my hips in snow im going to die that lasted until the hut where i sat down and recovered back to stage two where we just had rocks and general snow and then stage one where my generally positive demeanor returned because i didn t die and the weather was nice again all told not that bad
hiking,there no branding other than the design on the head of the stove no idea how old since it was found in my garage but i suspect at least older than years

hiking,i use osmand i think it probably worth paying the couple dollars a month for when you using it it lets you download topo maps of the area then so you can see you route on the map as you tracking without needing cell service tutorial would be something like importing gpx file to google earth but the gist is track using app it will record to a gpx file find gpx file on your phone or share from app if you can transfer to computer open with google earth or i think you can get it into google my maps too lots of apps can open a gpx file including the app you used to track it so you could get your friends to download osmand as well or one of the other offline navigation apps share your gpx route with them and they will be able to see the route and follow it on an offline topo map on their phones if you google gpx tracking hiking you likely find a lot of info
hiking,thinking about proposing to my girlfriend here whilst we are in the area next week would you say the spot you took the video from is pretty much what i should be aiming for looking for the best backdrop but dont know what you were standing on here thanks for any help

hiking,took a trip to greenville last weekend and was amazed at how green everything was already compared to northern virginia i was not enthused by the amount of pollen everywhere though
hiking,what is kind of weird is that at least superficially the landscape in the photo looks a lot like the landscape of far nw nevada and far ne california where i hike in the intermediate elevations of the desert when the higher mountains are deep in snow enough that it would take close looking to distinguish photos of one from the other yet climate and precipitation amounts are doubtless very different
hiking,of course they are amateurs not many hiking companies out there paying people to hike
hiking,if it looks like this in the us i will have to come check it out this is on public land high up where no one sleeps so pitching wherever is fine and safe is it possible to camp like this that side

hiking,yes but i ca speak to how well it works i mostly use it just for bringing up trail maps before heading out on small day hikes and maybe checking my position when encountering an unexpected intersection
hiking,absolutely gorgeous
hiking,wow that a great shot
hiking,gorgeous
hiking,a coat of clear matte polyurethane and a rubber chair tip from a hardware store on the end will make it last a lot longer i usually just use a bit of gorillia glue on the end but not the sides to hold the tip on pressure will force the glue up the sides this is with a light colored stain if you wanted color but that picture is of one made with magnolia which is an almost white color unfinished yours would be darker this is a more normal color stain but unknown wood it was felled by a beaver and left lying the channels are from bug activity it generally called wormwoord

hiking,awesome i did this trek about years ago absolutely beautiful
hiking,for sure it looks a lot easier than it is does the narrows as for observation point just absolutely beautiful

hiking,miles is km
hiking,hi commented on your post over in survival so if it helps i can answer these questions too if you haven t camped or hiked before it s a really good idea to do some one or two night trips before the big trip to make sure you have what you need and know how it works simplicity is key and carrying only what you need i ll give you my typical packing list so you can look some things up my tent is a tarptent rainbow one to two person with bug netting and built in groundsheet weighs just under in mild weather i use two closed cell foam sleeping mats from decathlon about each they fold easily for packing and one goes under my tent groundsheet to protect it the other inside i use either a down sleeping bag mountain equipment bought used off ebay down bags last for decades or a lightweight down quilt sierra designs backcountry your clothes need to be comfortable lightweight fast drying and not too many two pairs underwear lightweight anti chafe synthetic boxers two t shirts danish endurance tencel don t get smelly three pairs socks danish endurance running socks mountain hardwear lightweight nylon trousers north face nylon sun shirt berghaus fleece jacket marmot waterproof jacket paclite waterproof trousers merrel moab ventilator shoes or nike flyknit trainers sun hat fleece hat nylon shorts foam flip flops or sandals everything is fast drying so i can wash and wear don t try to hike too far too soon no more than miles a day at first blisters are common if you overdo it so take it slow and carry compeed blister pads you ll need a good torch too the petzl zipka is great if you want to be more stealthy with your camping you can use a bivy bag like the alpkit hunka much lighter but not so good in wet weather there are often good packs on ebay you ll probably need something litres depending on how much food you re carrying and how compact your sleeping bag is ultralight hikers often use frameless packs to save weight but i d advise you to get one with an internal frame and a comfortable hip belt there s a very nice osprey aether pack on ebay right now orange used low auction price you d be happy with that i don t usually use stoves now myself but the simplest and lightest would be a basic alcohol stove under a titanium or aluminium pot the best solar panel i know of at the moment is the anker powerport you hang it on your pack
hiking,at the beginning i said it that i knew it was a long hike without saying where i was starting from and then i realised that was a stupid thing to say so i edited it out i did add where i am starting from because it a long way and i kind of wanted to avoid people putting me off basically it will take a month i think and i not really following a trail just sort of going in a direction and wild camping where i can if that sentence makes you want to put me off then i was right to leave it out xd also i can see why the type of bag or clothes i take might depend on the length of the hike but the other two questions are that trip specific in my opinion so if you know the answer to those that would be nice
hiking,a lot of trekking poles breakdown with shock cords and you can just pack them in your checked luggage that what i did when i went to zion the whole park is amazing btw
hiking,there dozens of us
hiking,i have no idea how to answer any of that because i have no idea from your post what trail you intending to do you given basically no information whatsoever please rethink then ask again in a specific manner
hiking,you right it so tough to just scroll past things here on reddit that you are interested in
hiking,is it just a walking trail or a bike
hiking,we took to approach from liberty cap many in the group had done liberty two weeks earlier honestly this is a throw back picture that popped up in my facebook memory it was a hard hike but a great memory
hiking,nice did you tag the summit of liberty cap while heading out there or were you heading to snake dike approach
hiking,looks like a beautiful but buggy spot hopefully enjoyable early enough in the season
hiking,i not a native either in fact my gf and i just moved here from tx back in november i spent most of my life in chicago whereas she a native texan needless to say it been a much steeper adjustment curve for her but she a trooper haha
hiking,ugh nothing nice about that bog this one is lovely though
hiking,yes the great smoky mountains i did look at trails that showed the rhododendrons
hiking,i believe its dutch its really cool looks like christmas town
hiking,per the nps it is still unsafe in the month of march detected toxin concentrations have increased in the north fork of the virgin river to a level that poses a risk to recreators therefore a danger advisory has been issued for the north fork of the virgin river based on the concentration of cyanotoxins visitors are encouraged to avoid all contact with the water until further notice
hiking,from the jewish bakery
hiking,its well worth it stop by bishop for a mule kick sandwich and sheephearders bread as well
hiking,nice trick flashlights right very beautiful night sky
hiking,what parts of tn gsmnp the at through the roan highlands both good choices in june is the rhododendron festival at roan mountain with elevations around feet the temperature can be not too terrible even in june
hiking,with covid the entire system has changed for some parks typically the busiest for yosemite there are certain windows for example today was the day to get passes from mid may to june there is a date for people who want to get passes for july you log in to the website at and try to land a pass easier said than done the pass is good for days
hiking,i not a native but tend to end up in colorado every years around the same time and it the first time in the times i been that it been this cold and snowy in late april maybe i just got lucky on my previous visits with some early spring like degree weather
hiking,i tried to eat there last july the line was nuts i will try again thanks kind stranger
hiking,i been hiking in the mountains of new mexico regularly for the past years and new mexico has the most lightning strikes of any us state bar florida there been one time where i was deathly afraid of being struck by lightning so it is a real concern what happened was much as you describe i made it to the summit around noon or a beautiful blue sky day and shortly after i started heading down i heard thunder far off in the distance another mile or so hiking down the sky started getting dark and then it started raining and of course more thunder at this point my first thought was to head down as low on the mountain as possible so i started running downhill i was in the middle of a forest so avoiding trees was not possible and some people were huddling against trees which i did think was wise since if a tree is struck the charge can go down on the surface of the bark to the ground one lightning strike was so close i was momentarily blinded by the intense light felt the charge on my skin and hair and smelled the electrical smell in the air i think the strike was mere metres from me i did stop to find out i did make it down unscathed but this did put the fear in me i now avoid being high up in the mountains after noon during monsoon season july through early september here i honestly do know what the absolute best choice would be but i would suggest not being on a ridgeline and not being next to isolated trees
hiking,yes you are correct i am going in june
hiking,yes i am keeping an eye out i am not going until the last week of june
hiking,beautiful beautiful beautiful i d love to see more pictures like this
hiking,looks great
hiking,still have done this one potato chip rock is nearby yeah was it crowded
hiking,yeah i fort collins at the foothills and it snowing this minute as i look out my window we get a few inches a couple days ago too
hiking,wooooow
hiking,nope but i did stay in a holiday inn express last night
hiking,ahhh i did this in college what a great picture and awesome trek
hiking,at seconds the storm is a mile away from you sound travels with like through the air in seconds that would be which is around a mile i think
hiking,i just use a platypus in a normal day sack i feel it way more flexible
hiking,when your hair is standing up and you can give your buddy static shocks or the rocks are buzzing run downhill when you stop getting shocks in your teeth from your fillings you can probably stop good chance you will be getting hammered by hail about then so the trail will be getting slippery if you have a s external frame pack i would ditch that but what s the point of ditching a normal pack pull that over your head to fend off the hailstones
hiking,but you never been in a lightning storm on granite or up high have you could be wrong do think i am
hiking,what s the story to this place is it a neighborhood or just one property looks like a great place to explore
hiking,you get used to it eventually and it just turns to nostalgia i see pictures of deschutes county and silver creek falls all the time on here that my childhood
hiking,sounds good will check them out
hiking,my brain skipped a couple of words and read that as loch nevis which confused me greatly for a bit looks nice
hiking,i know it can be a little scary in a storm but times out of everything is gon na be fine no matter what you do in that scenario a little common sense goes a long way the fact that the poster is asking this question means they have good common sense and awareness hence it not that serious you be fine
hiking,really dude stay away from the mountains ok cubscout
hiking,so skiing
hiking,its behind my neighbours property i not actually sure who owns it
hiking,i love it here i always come to check the bridge after every major storm last year i saw two trees take out a huge chunk of the bridge it not very safe to cross anymore but i still take the risk eventually it will be nothing but until then i will enjoy every moment i can with it
hiking,haha that always amazes me too hello there d
hiking,agreed national parks have become a cheaper vacation spot for family s and i don t blame them i would take nature over disney any day specifically shuttle tickets at zion yosemite passes and rocky mountain np vehicle passes are short impossible to me at least
hiking,there are still a bunch of passes for end of may and all of june i just snagged one
hiking,this title has such gentle wistfulness about it
hiking,yeah no being stuck above treeline in a storm is extremely serious if you do think it is you should probably stay away from mountains
hiking,that depends on the park and what you are trying to get each park is different but most release in month long blocks anywhere from one to six months in advance it really sucks but without any development into additional capacity and continued ad campaigns there really are not any good solutions here
hiking,rmnp in the beginning of june no skills dealing with ice you wo have a lot of options there will still be a lot of snow there the park will also be very wet from all the meltwater and patches of snow you find may be undercut by meltwater you might be able to do emerald lake but you probably have to stay around the lower areas of the park
hiking,i do know dude i been caught in some pretty wild lightning storms on trips when you start hearing sizzling a little pee can come out
hiking,walking on skis
hiking,gorgeous shot
hiking,so
hiking,the snow does clear until july i once tried to hike to andrew glacier side of this image in late june but turned back because the trail was still covered in deep snow at the same time of the year i went to the nearby indian peaks wilderness there were still frozen lakes there
hiking,you should just one suggestion stay anywhere in chefchaouen but riad baraka the people who run that place really are not very nice i not joking ha ha i have more chefchaouen and other morocco videos in this playlist if you interested
hiking,thanks for the tour the place looks great we hope to visit there one day
hiking,i use an osprey raptor for basically all my day hikes it s a mountain biking pack which is admittedly why i bought it but it s perfect for holding a couple liters of water and has ample organization carries a lot more than it s capacity would suggest
hiking,hey is this on a specific trail this is my neck of the place
hiking,mother nature always bats last
hiking,if you hiking with a golf club this is your best bet
hiking,use your best judgment on how close the lightning sounds to stop hiking down sometimes it really is the best option to spread out sit on top of your pack and shelter in place rather thank march further into the storm the main goals are to be low to the ground and have as little of your body touching the ground as possible
hiking,it still snowing in the plains and in denver very snowy spring it been rather cold
hiking,getting lower matters more when you above treeline or on an exposed ridge and running is a good way to screw up no need to run rule of thumb is to count the time after you see lightning seconds or less when you hear the thunder and you should be considering where to go if it five or six seconds the storm is a couple of miles away and you should start looking for a spot to ride it out there more than enough on line on how to do that definitely want to stay away from water and solitary tall trees a tent is not the place to be but if it not safe to get out then yeah crouch on a pad got ta keep anything metallic away from yourself
hiking,thank you right place at the right time for sure
hiking,is a mess you have a window at a certain time to get any pass or it s sold out for the entire year it seems jeez
hiking,dude it not that serious just dont stand up on top the hill holding a golf club to the sky
hiking,awesome thanks for the response
hiking,you have perfect timing love the colors and the birds make the picture even better
hiking,i don t but please share your journey when you get back would love to see
hiking,you re not wrong but personally i love this park so much and the experience i have going here i love seeing other people s photos of zion as well because it s an awesome place happy hiking out there
hiking,you know what i saw something about that but no one mentioned anything about it at the park so i don t thinks so i fell into the water and everything and i am okay also walked barefoot in the river closer to the park entrance and no problems my experience anyway i would still try not to get any water in your mouth though
hiking,beautiful
hiking,i don t know how you did it without them it took all my strength to keep my knees and ankles in one piece even with the gear
hiking,um i think so but i bought mine while i was there for dollars and this walking stick came with the equipment package rental for this particular hike
hiking,this june i take the crowding into account which for me would rule out s ut for sure but n ut yeah and june is hot af in the lower bits of az but if you got up high it would be a good choice above the mogollon rim somewhere co would be nice but lots of the higher stuff is still snowbound in june you need that mama bear place where cool enough but no snow i look around near maybe grand junction and south of there some red rock like colorado nat mon up on grand mesa the gunnison ouray etc
hiking,i saw that there s a toxic algae bloom in the virgin river over there is the narrows safe to hike plan to go in a few weeks
hiking,this looks so mysterious could even be from a horromovie
hiking,well why not the new balance shoes they make a bunch of great trail running shoes and as you seen have very wide sizes lots of have been using them for years i on my gazillionth pair

hiking,ahhh i loved this trail too so much fun
hiking,i m going to zion in the summer can you get trekking poles on a plane
hiking,i ve hiked in all four and i would have to say that utah and colorado have the most dramatic views overall and are just generally more beautiful but if your looking for a more intimate and possibly more relaxing experience tennessee is a good choice although i think north carolina has better hikes than tennessee
hiking,science
hiking,thanks very much
hiking,good to see some florida trails thinking about hiking down that way spring of
hiking,depends on what they mean by day pass but generally speaking you have to pay to enter national parks there various passes or entry for certain groups if you want to hike or camp you tend to need a permit which either requires a reservation or i think they shifted to an online lottery system not but think you can do day hikes without any special permits which is what i mean a day pass could mean buying a day entry into the park but if you intend to camp or hike multiple days or if you targeting any of the popular trails you need a permit
hiking,walmart has some levi s that are around light weight moisture wicking and flexible i think they are called cargo pants but they re a cut very comfortable i ll be getting more of them soon

hiking,awesome thanks for sharing love it
hiking,yes i have it is not the valley i am so interested in but tioga pass area i have never been there you still need the pass though went there last year could not land the pass so i ended up hiking mammoth instead
hiking,i got an osprey daylight with the bladder no issues easy to fill and clean
hiking,have you been there before it s absolutely stunning
hiking,correct if you keep heading south you get to tinker i would guess about nine miles or so
hiking,thank you much appreciated
hiking,gee this almost never gets posted here
hiking,ever notice how when geese fly in a v formation one side is always longer this is because there are more geese on that side
hiking,i been on the at close to there when i was hiking i saw that body of water thought what river is that but it a huge reservoir not a river great place not too far from tinkers cliffs is it
hiking,was an amazing day thanks babe xxxxxxx
hiking,this has to be the inspiration for rick dream crapper rick and morty
hiking,i biased since i from utah but i say utah arizona is already hot as an oven by june and i imagine tennessee is blazing by that time as well southern utah where the mighty are would probably be around maybe with the exception of capital reef np however northern utah which is just as beautiful would have highs in the mid in the valley and very temperate mid to in the mountains my personal favorite in the summers is the uintah mountain range very temperate and the only range in the us that goes from east to west rather than north to south fair warning about the uintah range is that it can get moderately cold at night best advice is make a list of places you want to go and google the average temperature at these areas for the time you plan on going there
hiking,my pleasure
hiking,oooh man my favorite when i left colorado i lived in nyc for years and then la for years and i could never find green chili like this area has now i put it on everything haha

hiking,love a sunrise hike
hiking,yeah i think so too and lots of areas to explore and get outside if you don t mind driving a little bit out of town
hiking,i just moved back to cañon city from la a few months ago so it s been interesting exploring the area again as an adult i think the town of pueblo has gotten better coffee shops breweries etc but there s just not much around in the way of geography to enjoy when i was a kid though pueblo mall was the jam haha
hiking,thanks so much
hiking,i know that was so thoughtful of them it was such a peaceful morning that day
hiking,thanks it was so calm that morning the water was like glass
hiking,hahaha glad i happened to be there to catch it
hiking,lived there a couple years in the s grew to appreciate it and like it pueblo grows on you
hiking,i ve lived in the springs for over a decade ilive towards parker now ive always heard of pueblo and people always trying to move out of it but i never really saw it until i worked there for a couple days pueblo is not where i would chose the live but that s me
hiking,so skiing
hiking,beautiful
hiking,i highly recommend it and thanks
hiking,utah
hiking,i love this hike your photos are beautiful

hiking,waking up every day to that view must ve been amazing
hiking,early in my nursing career i spent a season there because i had experience in altitude sickness and dcs from my air force days it a magical place
hiking,thank u and got good editor
hiking,that looks amazing what route did you take

hiking,good bot
hiking,it s one of my favorite spots
hiking,they re the best part of this area
hiking,miles is km
hiking,i ve done about miles of it ten miles at a time and loved every minute of it
hiking,commenting to see the responses going this weekend and still haven t picked my hike was considering meigs mountain trails but i don t want to cross water get shoes wet not sure how warm it will be since it s snowing right now
hiking,lol who even knows where this stuff comes from anymore people have opinions on the zip offs i probably would have been better off wise with regular hiking pants once in a blue moon they really come in handy though i never regretted getting real although budget hiking gear i learned why people rave about sweat wicking fabric being outside is more fun when you comfortable
hiking,i ve been really looking into the zip offs but then i randomly started getting ads for scrubs and that s why i asked if that was a comparable thing honestly maybe my phone was listening to me talk about stretchy pants that are sweat wicking and somehow the algorithm threw scrubs my way
hiking,i seen people use items to hike but not scrubs the rei events i been attending suggest synthetics top and bottom my experience has been that they dry fast are more versatile have vent flaps sun protection etc i wear convertible hiking pants i do often unzip them into shorts but man is it a big convenience when i do if you do need something that the highest performance i just buy whatever synthetic hiking pants are on sale wherever i think you prefer them to cotton once you get some
hiking,there is no better way to end a day than strolling along the trails that wind through these rolling california hills especially with a sunset as beautiful as this one how would you prefer to end your day iso aperture focal length shutter speed sec find me on twitter or instagram to see more
hiking,having done that hike its a hard hike good job
hiking,yes most definitely
hiking,beautiful are there any gators in there
hiking,i am sorry i didn t get your reference
hiking,would love to visit this trail can you tell us whats the trail called
hiking,the annual zombie march
hiking,looks like a painting the at is so beautiful i need to do more of it
hiking,they are made of cotton cotton is poor material for hiking because it stays wet and does insulate when wet stick to synthetics check out prana zion or outdoor research ferosi they are pretty popular
hiking,i had put down our old rottie last year its difficult i know hope you doing well thanks
hiking,beautiful
hiking,in the first photo it rainier in one of the later ones it adams
hiking,beautiful i just had to put my male doberman down at years and he looked a lot like your guy he loved hiking the mountains in bc thanks for sharing
hiking,damn this must be the highlight of pueblo in the last decade
hiking,i know this hike
hiking,hiking project and co trex are two i use a lot
hiking,i like the tracking and historical data of alltrails i find it works well enough for my purposes it actually got me out of a couple sketchy jams when i had issues with route finding have never had to plan a route i would prefer if the social aspect of the app was increased a feed ability to tag hiking partners etc
hiking,caltopo and gaiagps alltrails is pretty useless for planning
hiking,beautiful picture i grew up so near there miss those mountains
hiking,hello i am looking at doing section e of the gdt this summer over days and i started to think about my food too recently mostly dreading bringing so much of it below is what i have previously done for day stretches is this the best or healthiest meal plan absolutely not but it did the job for both speed and space efficiency from my memory here is roughly what i ate everyday cliff bars each morning first thing before leaving camp coffee as i hiked or butter squeeze packs the justin squeeze packs are really packable and calories a pack a couple hours in was always tortilla with mayo hot sauce cheese and a tuna pack if i ran out of tuna i use nut butter instead i would also eat some candy like skittles or something snack was the same as morning snack something i could eat while walking was a rotation of ramen noodles or idaho potatoes with cheese and sometime mayo and hot sauce added i often added olive oil to my ramen to add calories afterwards i sometimes made hot chocolate or ate some more candy if i still had some my shopping list was somewhat like this for days boxes of granola bars clif and lara were my favourites box of justin almond butter packs pack of snickers block of hard cheddar cheese bag of tortillas many mayo mustard hot sauce packs from fast food places as i could muster little squeeze bottle of olive oil coffee squeeze bottle for electrolytes tuna packs ramen packs packets of idaho potatoes and then i would throw in random candy that i thought was that heavy or hot chocolate packs i say i was eating roughly calories per day depending on my snack consumption i was also on the pct and i was deliriously hungry at this point so i do think i bring as many bars or snacks this time because i do think i work up my appetite to that point i probably keep the same eating schedule though i may switch to oatmeal for breakfast instead because i wo be doing such long days this time also this subreddit has actually good meals you can make if you want to eat more diverse hiking food
hiking,i ve been twice and find it beautiful but unpleasant too much wind and blowing sand and hard to walk
hiking,caltopo alltrails is for following other people s routes
hiking,colorado especially since it ll be pretty hot in utah already by then
hiking,komoot route planning on a computer is easy and i especially like the ui in navigation mode where you can switch through different key info in the banner at the top like distance speed and an elevation chart
hiking,i never used all trails i use and it works great for what i need it for showing trail maps
hiking,thank you mine too so nice when you can catch that color
hiking,gaia gps way better than alltrails alltrails is only good for the social media aspect with finding trails you wan na do based on pictures the actual route planning part is bad month free trial
hiking,so jealous of the american wilderness you guys have it all
hiking,that pink in sunrise and sunsets is my absolute favorite great pic
hiking,utah
hiking,home of the great khans
hiking,utah arches bryces zion
hiking,thanks the colors were killer
hiking,utah or colorado
hiking,they don t give trail updates before june because they don t want people hiking earlier than that my friend works search rescue in western wa whatever you do don t get into a situation where his crew has to come find you
hiking,wow gorgeous
hiking,this is gorgeous
hiking,thank you really appreciate it i haven t started planning in detail yet this is a great tip
hiking,utah home to the big national parks followed closely by colorado
hiking,is that mt adams mt hood or mt rainer off in the distance
hiking,just incredible
hiking,we sure do
hiking,you do have much privacy and recognize how may people are around you above tree line in co the at provides a more personal hike it is all about what you you desire i hiked states of the at but wound up doing the rockies after my parents retired and i found my way
hiking,i love this place very peaceful
hiking,i hiked all to some degree all are wonderful bryce is my absolute favorite spot though so i say utah
hiking,thank you we have a beautiful hometown
hiking,colorado they have a a little of everything
hiking,depends on time of year fall tennessee winter arizona utah and colorado
hiking,amazing photos btw
hiking,home
hiking,colorado longs peak blaze it
hiking,got ta choose your battles airport mesa was almost full at but little horse which i thought was a much better trail was practically empty around
hiking,beautiful pic nice capture
hiking,been there done that
hiking,one more don t carry loud music with you that everyone else is forced to hear
hiking,thank you
hiking,i heard its impossible to find parking there
hiking,wow incredible stunning
hiking,at the risk of sounding overly negative unless you really know what you doing and what you letting yourself in for i advise against it the cuillins can be spectacularly dangerous and while the route google gives is moderately ok by cuillin standards at least it pretty much the only safe one and it would take much of a navigation error for the falling and screaming to start also although i have done the sums that feels to me to be pretty ambitious for a day walk unless you staying overnight at the bothy sorry for being such a negative nessie but would want you going on without at least a bit of a warning
hiking,i just tried a pair on at mec this weekend fairly light boot and seems to provide support i really wanted to like it however it did not even come close to fitting my wide feet it was their wide version however it still ran narrow in my opinion
hiking,you just have to have the park pass thing in your car
hiking,chirp
hiking,that is amazing
hiking,aye
hiking,do you mean camasunary
hiking,touche
hiking,spectacular
hiking,glissading down the first or so of elevation loss was super fun glad i brought my rain pants but people who skiied were able to go all the way from summit to parking lot which would be amazing
hiking,how was the ride down we did it last october and all i could think about was how much better it would have been to ski down
hiking,nice photos
hiking,shhhhh do tell people
hiking,awesome to hear i will definitely be doing one or the other within a year
hiking,do you need permits
hiking,oh last mile is very fine basically one step up one step down i did have poles but i do think that would help significantly standing stationary would result in sliding down
hiking,they are way too close when cornices go they often take several feet of ice past the overhang with them if you are at least back from the edge you probably too close some of the cornices on the southern aspects of the crater can have overhangs so you looking at more like back to be safe
hiking,blue bird typically means a clear day after recent snows ie powder day with blue skies this does look like a nice spring day up on helens though
hiking,appreciate it this sounds very similar to the end of the sahale glacier trail upto the campsite in the north cascades
hiking,easy to navigate going up a little harder coming down since pole is exactly obvious against rocks but hard to get lost i am an experience hiker so i did need much usual trail shoe partner was less and she used poles crampons not needed in september but definetely needed in early summer lots of hat and sunscreen no shade out there pro tip marked trail is not always the easiest way to go up i would suggest not climbing up if you see another path going around
hiking,thanks is it difficult to navigate or is the trail how much equipment do you recommend approach shoes poles crampons etc
hiking,tadoussac is what i meant and ok cool nice picture
hiking,i used to live on the other side too fly on over or better yet drive
hiking,i was covered up head to toe pale skin probs
hiking,it s not the same region but it s quite close though
hiking,my only other time was in late so technically fall but it had gotten a fresh snowfall i got to experience a little bit of the and i say hiking on snow is a hel of a lot easier also less with the ash you ca really give yourself extra traction whereas climbing on snow with microspikes or crampons you can make steady forward progress without any backsliding
hiking,lol yeah just missed
hiking,stunning photos wow
hiking,west coast mountains are much more that for sure
hiking,false summit is soulsucking
hiking,how am i supposed to go about my life normally with the knowledge that this place and my own state are technically part of the same country i just live on the boring side
hiking,south africa
hiking,western cape south africa close though
hiking,yes i wish
hiking,this picture just gave me sun poisoning
hiking,yes yes it is
hiking,jealous well done can i ask have you climbed it in summer as well i ve only done the summer summits and was planning to start training for bigger ones n winter starting with helens but i m curious as to the difficultly and what changes in shale vs snow
hiking,looks like a tough hike
hiking,i did it last summer let me know if you need more info around miles i can send you my gpx data not too difficult until the last mile that was hell
hiking,mine too but it s home so i m biased here
hiking,no one hikes there it is all switch back all the way up it was nice
hiking,they ha e picnic areas in national parks for a reason use those do not go off trail in sensitive areas it is also illegal to take any rocks plants animal byproducts etc from national parks so do
hiking,miles is km
hiking,if you aware you and your friends are loud go out of your way to be quiet on the trail people that project their voice miles away or use a speaker to play music are jerks follow leave no trace and check out the park website beforehand i also just want to point out that a national park might not be the best place to casually have a picnic people have to eat on the trail of course but it not like a picnic energy it might be more appropriate and fun to go on a local park hiking trail
hiking,haha
hiking,until a heavy storm at least
hiking,it more than likely that the north cascades in the states has the population of bc aside from the lower mainland bc has almost no people so less people to post about it on reddit
hiking,loved this hike one of my favorite national parks
hiking,i m saving for wool base next winter i can say that wool socks seem to be much better at regulating temp and almost never smell
hiking,looks like yosemite there is half dome
hiking,this a real place wtf
hiking,doing it in two weeks
hiking,not sure which circles your in while alpinisim is popular the hiking makes the front page of reddit fairly often garabaldi park is well known and of course whistler there is also joffree that gets a lot of attention the one big gap is there are very few well maintained and easily accessed multi day backpacking trips lot of there and back overnighters but there is a need for more remote trail building to connect numerous trails together
hiking,location
hiking,depends on some of the trails in that heavily used park there really are a lot of good spots to pull off like some of the nature trails and trails around the big trees often fencing anyway but on other trails like redwood canyon or even crescent meadow sure find a place out of the way of everyone view etc and you can have a nice picnic basically do hog a public area and btw you ca hunt rocks in a national park if said hunting means collecting
hiking,yea mailbox old trail is pretty brutal lots of high stepping i only taken it down not up
hiking,no if there are trails stay on the trails
hiking,going off trail even slightly is a big deal this is how single track trails end up being feet wide stay on the trail even if it is muddy or icy if you do want to get muddy run around
hiking,do go off trail most parks have picnic areas somewhere in them use them do be loud people head into nature to get away from the loudness of life do litter pack out more than you pack in
hiking,i recommend national forest if i remember correctly nf sounds most of sequoia np google leave no trace
hiking,the boulder field and up wasn t bad last time it was the trail up that killed me lots of huge killed my energy so excited for this trail
hiking,do take any souvenirs from the parks apart from pictures and whatever you buy at the gift shop that includes flowers and rocks one or two little things might not seem like a big deal but if you get parks with thousands of visitors every month each just taking one or two little things it can add up pretty quick
hiking,oh no well hope you can make it back again
hiking,you will see incredible views even if higher elevations aren t accessible
hiking,love it
hiking,many glacier road where this hike starts from won t open to even until may due to road construction so it likely won t open up to cars until mid to end of june i am sure and the plowing is pretty on schedule to where it normally is for going to the sun road from what i have been told so don t think it will open up much earlier than normal either
hiking,it s not too bad to get all the way up to the glacier a couple miles past this spot is about miles round trip and about feet gain over that full miles but i didn t really feel the gain much
hiking,how to not be annoying in any national park stay on the trails for your and your friends safety if nothing else look for picnic areas or day use areas for hanging out in don t litter
hiking,literally my favorite color
hiking,it definitely is really hard to get a bad photo
hiking,appreciate you asking the reason going off trail is frowned upon is because of the damage it can cause to plant life but there will be more than enough spots in dirt or on rock you be able spot from the trail to have a picnic you do need to be super careful if you around water that running swiftly not something to play with drowning is not uncommon and it no way to go what you do need to remember is to leave zero trace that you were there also rock hunting is bad mojo and illegal you ca take anything from a national park so please do and in terms of loud again not cool it disrupts others if you let the quiet and calmness of being out there run the show then you wo feel the need to be loud just groove on it that what you there for have fun
hiking,phone cameras can be impressive but are not capable of doing everything a camera can if you think you want to print large photos to hang on a wall and remember those hikes go with a camera i have a nikon and it is perfect for hiking if you just want to share the memories digitally and have no plans of making prints stick with a phone camera
hiking,thank you for your quick n helpful response
hiking,miles rt total gain is about it has sections where scrambling is involved
hiking,stay near the trail going off it slightly won t be a big deal don t be loud sound carries very far outside especially this time of year most importantly clean up after yourselves anything you bring in you pack out
hiking,kinda hard to go wrong honestly in june i would not venture too high up there will likely still be a lot of snow
hiking,thanks i ca find details about the monitor ridge route what is its approximate distance and elevation gain
hiking,still not great but more socially acceptable
hiking,i think they were a bit further away than the photo makes it look due to the zoom lens but yea those cornices are sketch and were especially windblown
hiking,would going off trail outside of a park be appropriate
hiking,you absolutely work up a sweat it was a pretty warm probably around at the parking lot at start time and up to mid on the mountain by midday always hard to tell the temp with the wind but that sun is intense layers and sun protection are key i ended up wearing just thin rei hiking zipoff pants a thin soft shell jacket and a long sleeve base layer honestly would have been quite comfortable without the jacket so long as i was moving i brought a packable down puffer for the rim but did end up wearing it as fortunately the wind had calmed down
hiking,in a national park you re supposed to stay on the trail so you don t damage the surrounding lands
hiking,the final push at mailbox is very actually maybe even steeper on average but way shorter distance but lots more pretty things to look up while working your way up msh
hiking,aw hell yea
hiking,i need to go back went there the summer of and it was right when the forest fire started so we did get to drive going to the sun road or see the other side of the park at all
hiking,the thousands of good trails part is tough got less than one week in co so still googling like mad men
hiking,upvoted it to
hiking,i always bring my nikon with me when hiking i like being able to control my depth of field which i ca do with my phone the cameras these days are as heavy as they used to be so it not as inconvenient if you really into photography i say go for it
hiking,it all good i live in the area and have seen a lot of people drive all the way across the country just to be really disappointed that they ca camp in the park also rmnp is only a tiny section of the state so if the permits dont work out you can always just choose another place to hike there are thousands of good trails in co
hiking,thanks for the info been doing si mailbox etc each weekend plus a few midweek hikes to prep hoping that s enough
hiking,i would say thanks
hiking,thank you kindly and we will make sure to get permits
hiking,i d say twice as hard as mailbox just because of the distance you are hiking in snow wish i would have gotten on the before lol
hiking,funny because i was driving past it last friday and was thinking about how nice of a view it would be up there climbed it last year on may with very similar weather glissading down was a blast good job
hiking,you need permits to camp in rmnp if you not have them a or day trip wo be possible check the park website office to see what is availablr please do camp illegally the rangers take it very seriously
hiking,how was the trail i am doing this one in a few weeks how would you compare it to something like mailbox in difficultly
hiking,too close to the cornice for me in that third pic woof
hiking,days at miles a day or miles a day
hiking,such a beautiful shot so calming
hiking,yeah i saw that thanks
hiking,just a heads up i have been reading that if you want to be able to drive the road you need a ticket from i think they go on sale on april look into it if you have already
hiking,how hot was it on the mountain we went a few weeks ago and thought it would be much colder so we layered up were so hot can only imagine with this great weather that its getting warmer even at altitude we are going again soon what do you suggest we wear to not get too hot or cold
hiking,right i grew up in the us and had no idea the volcanos out west looked like this truly shocking the first time you see them especially after driving from the east coast for the first time
hiking,winter route is about it called the worm flows route and begins at marble mointain summer route should be usable in not positive but it called monitor ridge i took it on my first summit hike in early oct
hiking,oh my thank you for the heads up i do what i can at least honestly i really just excited to be able to go to glacier it been a life long dream
hiking,what the name of the you guys took
hiking,that really beautiful
hiking,sure does
hiking,i m years old fingers get a bit crooked at my age
hiking,this was last friday about hours to summit including some stopping to switch between snowshoes and crampons and some photo breaks i think microspikes would be fine but snowshoes very helpful for the lower areas as it got pretty slushy by midday on the descent while we were very envious of all the people that got to ski or board down glissading down about of vertical not all at once was still very fun
hiking,yes took this picture on sunday perfect weather for hiking the dunes still quite a bit of snow in the higher elevations
hiking,fantastic day was this earlier this year how long did it take you to summit and did you ski or glissade down
hiking,awesome view was this a recent trip i heading there this weekend and wondering about the weather conditions gon na camp and hike here for a day then head over to mesa verde
hiking,what a great photo so neat to see these two flowers together
hiking,that beautiful and all but i do believe fingers are supposed to bend that way
hiking,reminds me of this rick morty episode
hiking,volcanos are wild
hiking,the cairn is a scottish tradition that signifies respect by adding a rock you are preserving the integrity of the monument and helping sustain it further
hiking,mile loop this trail passes picnic areas and takes you down to the eno river after you cross the bridge their is a steep foot climb to the top of a hill and the descent this is a beautiful hike but not for the novice unless you just want to go down to the river then double back
hiking,damn didnt know it ran to richmond runs by my grandparents house in selma
hiking,awesome beautiful pictures
hiking,lol my photography it s actually a very nice trail within the city of that surrounds salem lake it circles the entire acre lake it s miles long partially paved but most of it is path and dirt it s a very safe trail too salem which is a old old city george washington traveled and spent the night in a building that still stands merged long ago with the city of winston which is old in itself but not as old as old salem and it became no witch trials just a old historical place that use to be the home center of rj reynolds tobacco winston cup racing hanes hosiery maya angelou krispy kreme doughnuts honda jet the river run international film festival and this hidden gem of a urban hiking biking running equestrian trail
hiking,god i need to go there
hiking,in case you did know george bird grinell was a leading conservationist of early america and a proponent of our national park system
hiking,dang i going in a month or so late june i just read that they received less than average snowfall this season so they already starting to plow the roads at the higher elevations i really hope i get to see this when i go
hiking,just some geese and ducks but there are eastern water snakes racoons and probably other wildlife there
hiking,quebec is magic
hiking,i have one of these mementos the cup won t shrink or wear out
hiking,wow what a view how was the trail to get out there
hiking,now that a picture right there
hiking,oh wow wonderful it really nice to walk in nature fully alone
hiking,i hiked this trail in september we had a very overcast day which was a bit of a bummer but it was still stunning made it all the way up to the glacier and could get over the color of the lakes gatorade blue is a description
hiking,i have to give it a go some time this summer
hiking,hard to believe stuff like this actually exists awesome pictures
hiking,crazy that the reality of hiking in glacier for sure
hiking,i have never seen a bad picture from gnp it on my list of places to travel
hiking,our local brewery running club does a lot of commemorative items christmas ornaments with the date maybe a picture from the peak the mug as someone else stated a picture and frame a bottle opener from the peak lots of options
hiking,the first time i tried this hike my bud and i turned a corner and found ourselves in danger close proximity with a huge grizzly we didn t make it to the glacier lol amazing hike in an amazing place
hiking,it was awesome stepping outside on a open car beautiful running by
hiking,golden eagle is a wonderful day hike
hiking,you could always acid etch a stainless steel campfire cup with what ever information on it nifty to look at and functional
hiking,thank you we started at am
hiking,so beautiful
hiking,me tooooooo
hiking,i completely agree thank you
hiking,it s a beautiful classic spot for sure
hiking,me too can t wait to repeat this year
hiking,it is likely the trail won t be fully accessible in june i did it in july a few years ago and only there first half of the trail was open and the rest closed because of too much snow
hiking,thanks how was the train i grew up out here but for some reason i ve still never taken the ride
hiking,i havent ventured to the bft yet but would love to ive also had my eye on the golden eagle trail for a nice day hike hopefully soon
hiking,the water is flowing beautifully right now drfinitely a great time to visit and see all the falls flowing
hiking,probably my favourite hike of all time loved it
hiking,i have taken city view from the highest point tilla charouni on margalla hills check it out here
hiking,wan na be there
hiking,i just looked it up sac area right went camping in that area as a kid it was so amazing
hiking,watch your footing when i went there in two people fell down the switchback section one broken arm and an unknown leg injury it also a mile round trip if you do take the boat ride you also going to be in the sun almost the entire day on that trail i would recommend taking a toddler on it but that just me a bit older like would be able to handle it though there are a lot of other easier hikes with good views that you can take a youngin on like avalanche lake or the highline trail which ends up at grinnell overlook and that about a mile round trip
hiking,so that what it looks like from the top we recently took a train ride at the bottom so now i see thanks for the great picture
hiking,always love seeing pics of my home can t wait to get back on this trail this year
hiking,are you happy with the photos you get from your camera is there some kind of shot you specifically want that you can t i have a dslr but i use it for wildlife photography unless there s some particular aspect of photography you want to pursue its probly not worth the expense if there is something you want to pursue then go for it
hiking,some cliff blocks and gatorade help me push through a hike when my energy dropped and legs turned to rubber i always pack them now
hiking,i have an osprey pack different and it nice should be fine for the job yes your current will do you for snowdon just bring dense snacks and you wo be able to fit much spare clothing in there snowdon in the summer usually is very challenging though llanberis is a long and not very interesting drag is too long and is quite interesting mildly scrambly not done the others recently enough to recommend
hiking,also i be going from camuslary all the way back upto sligachan again not back the way i came over
hiking,montana is in the top for most beautiful states
hiking,sure no problem
hiking,talon is a great bag absolutely love mine not great when it chucks it down though so i use rain cover from another bag

hiking,personally i would go with a tesco plastic carrier bag put a spare in each pocket for reserves just in case the one you using suffers a critical failure
hiking,man i was up at azguard pass and the ones lakeside were the worst things i ever seen i hope it was funky
hiking,check out ferne clyffe state park
hiking,start by putting weight in the pack and start with the hip belt it is supposed to sit around your waist at a height at which it can carry most of the weight of the pack then check how the harness sits on your shoulders oh i actually just found a guide made by another backpack manufacturer with pictures so this will probably help more than my writing
hiking,i pretty much stopped using these sport snack things they do really taste good are expensive and i do feel like i need them proper sandwiches are nice to have on a long day with ample amounts of your favourite fillings the only exception for me is electrolytes in hot weather over time you start to lose electrolytes through sweating if you do replenish them any water you drink feels like it comes straight through as your body controls its balance of saltiness so i sometimes use those tablets that contain electrolytes in my water
hiking,the difference is most apparent when you sweated some and then come to a stop in cool and cold conditions you feel pretty cold very fast with any synthetics but the merino evens it out impressively well also they fantastic on trips as they do need to be washed nearly as often and do develop nasty smells definitely worth a try i nowadays only use synthetics when going on a bike ride walk jog cross country ski run where i do have breaks in between
hiking,this is not winter in any mountains
hiking,i do know why but if you wore the mask because of covid you are doing it wrong these masks filter only incoming air but let your air out unfiltered they are normally used for construction

hiking,you could bike down glenwood canyon on the bike path although if you re coming this spring the water would be over the path from the run off i d say a good and iconic hike would be about minutes south of there capital lake if you really feel ambitious take the hike to conundrum hot springs but make a reservation

hiking,we too have a osprey poco plus highly recommend it our youngest is almost months olds and he is as happy as a clam when inside the pockets are great it s adjustable so my husband and i can both wear it and the storage is also fantastic if you need to trek a few more items
hiking,should read looking out in yosemite valley
hiking,go to and search baby backpacks like any pack it s wise to try them on with weight get the sun shade hiking the southwest s canyon country by hinchman is a great road info source hint avoid the big name parks and go to national monuments
hiking,i had a kelty through three kids over about yrs and it was one of the best baby gifts ever solid durable with all kinds of add ons like sunshades loop hangers backpack modules but the best feature was the kickstand can t tell you how many times it let a sleeping kid lie they might be a little pricey but well worth it for features and durability
hiking,we have the osprey poco ag and really like it used it a lot until our kid was around two and she just wanted to walk everywhere it s pretty light and comfortable on your back but not great storage i always see them on facebook marketplace i think we got ours for

hiking,water is what you need adding flavor is a personal choice to what you want stop every hour to drink if you moving all day consume calories every hour some salty some sweet when you stop for the day take in protein and carbs for recovery drink a lot to fully hydrate take with you what you will enjoy eating nuts dried fruit chocolate candy bars cheese and crackers salami and more candy bars
hiking,i a big fan of osprey too i actually looking to upgrade my huge old and heavy northface pack with the atmos either that or a gregory paragon
hiking,i went there about years ago now one of the most amazing and moving experiences i have ever had
hiking,pretty sure you should ve tagged this nsfw
hiking,it leaves an impression that for sure d
hiking,mindless scrolling hey that looks like whitewater
hiking,stunning north carolina will always take your breath away
hiking,osprey make very good rucksacks i have a xenith and it has been great i am sure they will do smaller size and ones to fit all people but it is a great brand
hiking,just looked at and it appears to have a daisy chain a bag might be tough but you should be able to get a pad on there maybe some of her clothes in the front pocket will create enough room for a bag good luck
hiking,this is breathtaking perfect place for a picnic with a good book
hiking,eh kinda there was a few people but not a whole lot
hiking,thank you for the reply i actually do have an rei tarn that might just do the trick if i can strap a sleeping bag and pad to it i figure that plus her clothes and a personal water bottle will do it
hiking,always happy to help happy trails
hiking,this must be at paradise valley because that is the sphinx in the back nice photo
hiking,gopher snake unless you from az where they are confused and call them bull snakes
hiking,ten pounds wo need much space so i probably go with something more towards the day pack size that comes with a hip belt that be something she can use later maybe something along the lines of an extra small osprey tempest the big thing you need to do is have her torso measured she going to grow and you want something that has decent fit now but will work a couple years down the road have a great time something very cool to introduce her to and anything up around tuolomne is going to be eye candy
hiking,these photos are amazing
hiking,i love living in nc i m in the perfect spot too great cities i m in clt so football games even though it gets a little more stressful everyday a short drive to some of the oldest and arguably most beautiful mountains in the country or i can go east instead and visit multiple great beaches as well as the two lakes within a min drive from my house i dig it i dig it real good
hiking,so cool
hiking,it pretty over exaggerated how much you need those hydration supplements when hiking people hike the for thousands of miles without using any of that stuff and have no issues what you really need is good salty snacks dried fruits and enough water though it always a good idea to bring some sort of hydration supplement for emergencies look into powdered pedialyte on amazon that what i use it relatively cheap and tastes good ca remember the last time i ever needed to use it though
hiking,whoa i ve never heard of a forest scorpion hope i see one sounds like something mythical i have a good headlamp and well prepared but i just don t do a lot of hiking in the dark so i want to be careful thanks for the info
hiking,it s open to the public
hiking,it was really nice out only about in the canyon
hiking,early season has been a blast with so many trails within close proximity of missoula and at lower elevations no more ice and snow yesterday vida rz challenged us to the pengelly ridge route to the of mount sentinel the sun was warm on our backs as we made the ridge and started the steep for mile and half after that first section this hike is an enjoyable cruise we found loads of bitterroot along the rocky portions of the route
hiking,you re welcome i m from michigan but these were all the places we found when we were down there in for a week i d never saw a white squirrel until then
hiking,i typically do this one as a sunset hike and find the hike back out relatively easy with a good headlamp and you get the added bonus of the chance to see a forest scorpion they are nocturnal and fluoresce under natural moonlight which is seriously one of the coolest things i ve seen with my own eyeballs
hiking,i saw a handful of folks but pretty quiet generally speaking for such a monument i went towards the end of the day sunday
hiking,i saw a white squirrel yesterday so amazingly cute and different than the florida squirrels i typically see might have to check out that toy store thanks for all these reccomendation
hiking,did you by chance continue down to the bottom so many steps i also recommend continuing up and going to rainbow and turtleback falls both very pretty as well
hiking,great picture i m thinking of doing this how was the hike down in the
hiking,whiteside mountain in cashiers has a nice trail up around it if you head to brevard there s an awesome toy store named o p taylor s there s white squirrels on the campus in town looking glass falls in pisgah just outside brevard was nice roadside falls if you head into highlands and drive to franklin there s a handful of falls along lazy hiker brewing in franklin some decent outdoors stores in both highlands and brevard

hiking,i figured we ll probably just do it as a normal hike then thanks for the help
hiking,it was very busy the day i went it was a monday but fairly good weather which was maybe a factor but it was busy enough it was hard to maneuver the trail in some parts

hiking,i will definitely be adding this to my list for sure
hiking,bruh i was just there like last weekend lol it so steep

hiking,yes it can get quite buggy down in the lower elevated mountains or in valleys wilson s creek area gets very buggy during summer

hiking,what in the premium alltrails is this map it looks so fancy
hiking,wanted to upload this pic i took of my two mates in having been in lockdown restricted to zoom calls we decided to celebrate the easing of guidance over summer by tackling the ben lawers range we an avid wee group of munro baggers so we were delighted to take days to catch up complete the range we arrived on friday night camped at a local reservoir set off around the next morning from there we walked into our first munro meall a choire leith followed by meall corranaich beinn ghlas ben lawers an stuc meall garbh finally meall greigh visibility was fairly poor that morning we could see much more than metres ahead until we reached ben lawers from there on out it was possibly the most beautiful scottish summers day i ever experienced it was quiet the sun was out and we were midge free we completed the range at around people talk about tackling one or two munro from the range in a day but it very possible to complete all would recommend this hike to anyone who finds themselves in scotland
hiking,just reverse image search it
hiking,how far is this from charlotte airport i have a hour layover in clt
hiking,i use my leave to travel for more than a weekend you can stretch your leave by taking days off that encompass a holiday if i m flying i prefer to fly in the evening after work and return the evening before i go back to work or morning of
hiking,head back north towards sapphire park at the first bridge mile on the east side of the road you see a trail take it south mile you see a trail on your left a goat trail scramble down it and you have the top of the falls to yourself
hiking,almost like an ewok
hiking,depends on where you go up in the mountains it usually not too bad but once you get into the region it can get pretty vicious but it something you learn to deal with get good bug spray wear long sleeve shirts and pants ect though as a side anecdote i once took a day canoe trip down the lumber river towards the coast about an hour outside wilmington and brought hella bug spray and anti bug gear it is literally a swamp and we went in july but to our astonishment we had no issues with mosquitos at all i never even felt the need to put on bugspray coincidentally i saw more dragonflies than i ever seen in my entire life on that river turns out that why there were no mosquitos would recommend
hiking,yes gnat in the eye every summer hike
hiking,quick question since this is in the humid part of the country does it get really buggy in summer to enjoy hiking i am in the west where it is pretty dry and bugs are a big problem
hiking,thank you it is so serene

hiking,grandfather mountain if you got the time also south mountain state park is an easy beautiful hike with a big waterfall really there so much nature in nc it impossible to pick just a few spots i was born and raised in nc spent my travelling most of the us and ended up right back in north carolina there just something about it
hiking,nice
hiking,fuck everyone for posting pic showing pictures online is exactly why all these places are ruined no matter where you live locals have their spots now with bs internet post more and more spots are ruined you want to see it go out and find it anyone with that mentality will be respectful to the land
hiking,alltrails can be helpful select a trail you interested in scroll down to reviews then sort by newest first to see what people have reported recently
hiking,haha i bet they weren t that s a lot for days i will have days so i might start at the fish hatchery and go from there i ve done section hikes up to the fish hatchery

hiking,the snow is softening up no ice it s definitely going to be a mud bath soon the parking system starts may i think you can already get reservations online their will be cars allowed per day with a max of people per car
hiking,maybe ironically the grass is always greener but living in pa i am sick of green forests and woods all over the place i want this
hiking,there is a small place under the falls that might be a good place to drink a beer and smoke a j

hiking,wait where is the orange hue you edited this didn t you
hiking,moving to denver in august i m wondering what are some good hikes in the area
hiking,i feel like i see some way in the background
hiking,i agree that place is breathtaking thank you for sharing
hiking,makes sense we have multiple national parks in marin but i left that comment after returning home from a bbq with some older locals from west marin they were telling me about how the county maybe eradicated all the fallow deer and wild pigs by paying professional hunters to exterminate them and burn the bodies instead of selling tags i do really like how muir woods has a reservation program instead of a free for all we do a lot of trail mate matenaince ourselves because the parks do do a great job especially with poison oak in the winter and trash
hiking,i highly recommend it
hiking,please do just plan your trip there
hiking,agree
hiking,hope to be able to see this in person someday before it s too late
hiking,cool that yucca very useful plant you can make a soap substitute with the root and use the spike at the end of the leaf to make a needle and thread to fix tears in gear and the stalk makes a great fire spindle good stuff
hiking,just incredible
hiking,thanks yes it really beautiful
hiking,oh wow that goes on the list greetings from lapland

hiking,intressting
hiking,oh my gosh this really is amazing
hiking,so beautiful
hiking,beautiful view
hiking,its a shame the worst of the problems there could be greatly reduced by just having some park wardens walk the busier trails people going from people taking selfies littering unfortunately they do not or did when i was there
hiking,muir does have anything to do with marin really it a national monument so it technically federal land if i were to hazard a guess i say it was due to covid and restricted work in the park in years prior the understory was always well manicured and debris from storms and humans alike was dealt with quickly
hiking,this country really is beautiful so happy i live in the southwest
hiking,beautiful dog
hiking,ayy i was there last saturday
hiking,whew looks crazy hot
hiking,hatch
hiking,i wish i m looking to do some backpacking there this year unfortunately i ve not been anywhere beyond the angel s landing but i love it there feels otherworldly
hiking,my big monkey follows me with a camera
hiking,there s some right there
hiking,he looks out over the forest and wonders what out there
hiking,nice selfie did you use a tripod
hiking,that actually a rather large assumption on your part while yes your advice may be true the manner in which you say it is unkind please be more respectful next time
hiking,it looks like it s already hot af over there edit i did not expect it to be in the s
hiking,that s so beautiful i just moved to wy a couple years ago and haven t even begun to scratch the surface of all the cool places to explore
hiking,he is a smart boy thank you
hiking,thank you

hiking,beautiful photo
hiking,right it s crazy to think some years ago the nez perce used this canyon to escape persecution from the us army i ve been trying to find the way they did it and it just blows my mind not only did they escape but they brought several hundred horses with them
hiking,neat just spent a week traveling nm we saw the bisti badlands
hiking,such a beautiful canyon
hiking,agreed they need to call in some of them firefighting goats
hiking,a quite steep trail that drops nearly in less than a mile hiking poles and sturdy boots are highly recommended would not recommend this trail to someone with a fear of heights
hiking,emyn muil

hiking,baylor
hiking,was there two years ago in this time of year the waters are high amazing place to visit and quit unique
hiking,i love the organs and i love biking in that part of the world
hiking,i have an itinerary that i give to anyone going there that really made a spectacular trip for me it s the most incredible place strongly suggest
hiking,one of my favorite places although it understory was looking pretty rough last time i was there looks like they have been as active in their forest clean up
hiking,looks like a place i need to go
hiking,yep april permits are accessible weaverville ranger station day nights much snowier than i expected
hiking,nice time lapse was this in april what were the temps did it require a permit ahead of time for camping
hiking,congrats we all proud that you went outside your comfort zone hope you loved it
hiking,ours have to be maintained regularly it s winter the batteries discharge so while there we switch out the memory card also cell signals are weak to nonexistent and we can t afford satellite connections for some sending images over the air could be of use i d guess but not for us
hiking,looks spooky may be because of the name
hiking,yes but deadliest on decent if i remembering correctly
hiking,no i haven t but was next on my list
hiking,solid hike have you done poo poo point recently
hiking,i personally try to not erode studied and scientific values with my personal anecdotes of what i think is right in each scenario to rebut your points it is a dangerous path to justify eschewing of values because someone did it before you a road or a radio tower has no intrinsic bearing on how wild the animals are nearby second animals approach food whether they are wild or not it seems silly and lacking in perspective to me to make that assumption and carve out an exception for yourself lnt no exceptions or everyone makes just one exception for themselves and nature gets filled with exceptions
hiking,one of my favorite hikes
hiking,on valentine day i went to do a fairly short desert hike with some slot canyons and a bit of cross country skills i had notes a map compass etc my notes said while hiking up a slot canyon to find a native american shelf to climb up the canyon wall i could find it and eventually ran into a dry waterfall too big to get up i turned back and found a small gully that i was able to climb up what i did realize was the top was the top and it kept getting steeper i ended up on my hands and knees but made it up without to much problem i was now on a giant plateau but my hike was supposed to be a loop so i was too concerned with getting off i found my way across to the other side of the plateau fairly easily but then could find a trail down into the main canyon my notes indicated a smaller canyon could be used to get out as well so i tried every smaller canyon i could find only to get stopped by dry waterfalls everytime i decided to go back to the other side of the plateau thinking maybe i could find the shelf i was supposed to use to get up i found an old trail that seemed to go where i needed it too but the trail washed out and there was no way i could safely go any further on it annoyingly from that spot i could see my car i tried to find where i came up but could find the spot i was finally able to descend into the canyon i climbed up idiot me ran into a small dry fall that i could climb down but felt i could climb up it should of occured to me that i had seen this dry fall earlier i got over it only to discover the big dry fall that i seen earlier was all of yards past it i was now stuck inside a narrow canyon without reception somehow by sheer force of will i was able to climb over the small fall and hiked down canyon but again was stopped by a dry fall i tried climbing partially up the walls and seeing if i could work my way around to some place i could safely enter the canyon past the dry fall but alas the walls got too steep i ended up climbing back up to the plateau and heading back to the other side at this point my shadow was getting longer and i had some concerns about water i heard a coyote in the distance and i was aware i might have to spend the night in the desert which sounded very cold and not something i wanted to do my girlfriend was obviously very freaked out but luckily i had signal on top of the plateau while walking along i saw a faint trail hidden behind a hill that led into a canyon but did seem to climb out the other side annoyingly i had seen this trail earlier before i had attempted to get out and had forgotten about it this trail actually climbed into a canyon i tried earlier in the day but had gotten stopped by a dry falls i let my girlfriend know that if it did leave me out it would be hours or so before i would have signal sure enough it led right out and i watched an amazing desert sunset my short mile hour hike turned into a mile hour hike there was a wind advisory that day which made for some harrowing moments on a few very narrow and steep ridges and i definitely ruined valentine day but made it up for it the next night with some homemade sushi tldr ruined valentine day by climbing up to a plateau in the desert and not being able to find my way down thanks to a series of dry falls
hiking,wow look at all the graffiti terrible looks like it seems a ton of traffic
hiking,im jealous
hiking,love this spot visited a couple of years ago absolutely a must see
hiking,yes i went there on my honeymoon with my first wife back in i did the rock scramble at in the morning in flip flops because i m stupid i had been dying to go back for years now i ve been twice in months going back to hike from minnewaska to mohonk and back soon
hiking,thats where they were if youll call off lnt in the middle of a protected state forest surrounded by trees for miles in all directions then theres no limit to carving out exceptions for ourselves
hiking,definitely a goofer snake no not a misspelling
hiking,that s jim
hiking,looks beautiful
hiking,heads up for anyone that goes the park only sells so many tickets per day and can sell out during the busy season get your tickets in advance
hiking,sneckey snek
hiking,lumpy
hiking,a nope rope all snakes are nope ropes the ones that you almost step on are nope ropes
hiking,have you been to the mohonk preserve down the street the rock scramble through the cliff to the tower is worth it
hiking,i go with a gopher snake
hiking,i d poop my pants that s a gopher
hiking,the place is incredibly gorgeous the most beautiful place i ve ever been and the types of views you usually need to go west to see
hiking,that looks like a gopher snake harmless but known to have an attitude
hiking,one of my favorite places
hiking,organ mountains are beautiful
hiking,where s your sweater from
hiking,i m lucky to have a job with decent benefits where i can take time off i can also work holidays and some regular overtime occasionally and use it later as comp time i think last year i took weeks of time off so that s how i do it beyond that planning things well to increase efficiency helps if time is limited you don t want to waste time driving or whatever when you don t have to finding the cheapest flights at times that give you the most time at a destination centrally located lodging etc
hiking,yeah i get that more hidden in plain sight i say that because i visibly passed it and didn t even notice until i did some digging for short hikes along
hiking,convict lake is one of the most photogenic lakes in the sierra that one can drive to and then go for a little walk around even while wearing jeans
hiking,beaut eh
hiking,one of my favorite places to hike in southern il
hiking,i been there the drive was truly long af haha
hiking,you literally posted a picture of someone hiking in jeans where the assumption
hiking,i totally agree as an avid backpacker i am aware that it is better to wear synthetic or wool to stay warm and dry however my boyfriend and i were minutes from the car and not actually hiking so that being said please don t make assumptions
hiking,please do hike in jeans google cotton kills it incredibly dangerous to wear it in the backcountry and in the winter especially
hiking,this is pretty random but do you use cameras that push images automatically if not is there interest i was talking to some friends the other day and they expressed a need for something like that since it a pain to go retrieve all the images i looked around and did see any great options i asking out of personal interest maybe it will motivate me to build a product anyway cool pic
hiking,when you ve seen it you never it i was rapid scrolling and said ohh plitvice and scrolled back up i teared up three times there
hiking,though congrats did it in next time it ll come up it s gon na be nah thanks been there done
hiking,looks like a great team i am a one man team so far wifey is into hiking but we are expecting a baby boy in september and ca wait to hike with him that kinda what made me ask for the photo
hiking,ah me too it s so beautiful anytime of year
hiking,i love convict lake
hiking,i did it one of the best experiences of my life days
hiking,this hidden gem is right here on the map lol something about claiming something to be great due to it being hidden and then immediately giving directions strikes me as funny
hiking,a group of convicts escaped from a prison in carson city and made camp here they were eventually caught tho
hiking,climbers
hiking,why is it called that
hiking,you could be right been about years since i ve been in nc but i do have a memory on a clear day looking out from some spot up in the blue ridge mountains and seeing skyscrapers way way off at the horizon and my nc friend telling me it was charlotte
hiking,where is this at
hiking,such a pretty snow waterfall glad that you got to see it from a safe distance instead of being in it
hiking,i believe you are thinking of crowders mountain outside of charlotte this mountain is between and mount airy
hiking,it was very peaceful too
hiking,good to know i ll definitely be jumping in that water
hiking,looks pleasant
hiking,what kind of goats are those
hiking,tip for next time if you keep going up to the second or third ledge the number of people drops off significantly and you get a higher view for whatever reason very few people keep going past the first one despite the third not being that much further happy hiking
hiking,shawangunk mountains lake minnewaska sp new paltz ny
hiking,yes we have plenty of experience i just didn t want to give the vibe that we are avid climbers all the time thank you though that is good to know as far as no turning back more research ahead
hiking,please look at the title
hiking,omg you are so lucky i love croatia your culture and people i been there many times this is my favourite place on earth
hiking,when i was there couple of years ago swimming in some lakes was allowed
hiking,what a calming place to be
hiking,lol the way the pup face is popping up
hiking,dope that fog
hiking,my country hit me up if you have any questions
hiking,yeah looks great but it cold when i was a kid we go further down river outside the np and freeze but it was super fun
hiking,me
hiking,thanks it was amazing looking over the edge
hiking,good job that s a fun hike with great views but you got ta work for it
hiking,cool picture i love fog
hiking,if you re bored and interested her are or so snowshoe pics
hiking,thanks bud just thought i d ask water looks very inviting lol
hiking,swimmimg is not allowed
hiking,yeah its a really beautiful area i think its limestone
hiking,i
hiking,you can see all the tourists on the bridge it a beautiful place but i absolutely hated it i hardly been anywhere in nature so packed with obnoxious tourists
hiking,croatia hast at each moment been on mine own bucket list but anon i a gorgeous new spot to add i am a bot and i swapp some of thy words with shakespeare words commands shakespeareinsult fordo optout
hiking,croatia has always been on my bucket list but now i have a gorgeous new spot to add
hiking,is that limestone beautiful area
hiking,have been in a decade or more but looks great definitely on my list to go now i back into hiking
hiking,i recommend leavenworth wa not too far from seattle absolutely breathtaking hiking enchantments you need a permit to backpack but you can say hike without one colchuck lake is stunning
hiking,is it possible to swim there just wondering always wanted to go
hiking,i love snowshoeing but most ever snowshoe area is a mess now getting way off trail is the only way you were lucky that s great it s a pretty area
hiking,it does life isn t often fair
hiking,did that beast once for pt when i was stationed at ft carson congrats
hiking,very much so
hiking,the onion
hiking,i absolutely loved this such an adventure
hiking,perhaps we have to agree to disagree i do think the right way to build a community and expand out ranks is to tell people they doing it wrong cuz lnt without more thoughtfully considering the context i be with you if this person was tossing a probar at deer off the cable line but giving a bird tame enough to land on her a bite of nut is not my opening to educate that feels like a reductionistic interpretation of guidelines not a thoughtful consideration from first principles in any case i mean this seriously thank you for being polite in this disagreement
hiking,so is third
hiking,meooow
hiking,i once decided to use yaktrax tldr do do that i had hiked one at the time and my roommates wanted to do grays and torreys it was october so i knew it be snowy my boots were waterproof and warm enough to handle the low temperature but they were unusually bad with ice i bought a pair of yaktrax for that reason instead of digging into the snow and giving me traction the yaktrax trapped a bunch of snow to the bottom of my boots and packed it down one of the yaktrax boke and fell off just a few miles into the hike and i had even noticed by the time i noticed the other one had already broken given that they had already proven to be worse than useless i took the remaining one off and put it in my bag that left me high in the mountains in october with boots that had worse traction than an ordinary pair of shoes with nothing but deep snow and cliffs for miles i still made it to the summits but i still had to make the descent in those boots i probably slipped and fell over times on that hike
hiking,oooo a loop trail whenever i see one of those i just want to do the whole thing in one go
hiking,try it once i got my wife in board a couple of years ago she previously thought the same way but after a couple of amazing experiences she is totally on board not that i do it every day of vacation i usually rotate getting up early for the very popular locations and sleeping in and going with off the beaten path locations
hiking,where is this place
hiking,i highly recommend it you can camp there as well
hiking,it would be on my travel list if i lived near ontario
hiking,awesome you have a lovely smile btw
hiking,good ol camp robbers
hiking,do you have a trailhead name
hiking,inspirational keep up the good work
hiking,yes it s magical
hiking,i try to go here at least twice a year have been for a while now due to obvious reasons there is this one lookout point where you can almost always find red tailed hawks you eye level with them as they circle around it absolutely amazing
hiking,i wish i had that kind of discipline to go to bed hours early
hiking,i always bring a tripod with me on my hikes there was also tons of people there could of just asked one of them to take it for me
hiking,leave no trace applies everywhere whether in the remote backcountry or a city park lots of people don t know about it and education helps ensure that outdoor areas like tiger mtn which happens to be right in my backyard are around for everyone to enjoy for years to come i m assuming that that is important to you as well if you re on this sub we can all make a small impact not trying to be self righteous or get into any arguments just educate hope you have a wonderful day
hiking,the view of perfection
hiking,the waterfall carries on right up the gorge but the incline levels off enough to safely cross the falls and head up the side
hiking,looks great how far up does the climb go
hiking,thank you brother
hiking,the lockdown gave me the impetus to get out there and give it a go i haven t looked back loving it give it a go
hiking,thanks for reminding me of this great place to hike close to home
hiking,how u take the first pic
hiking,great weekend to go the weather has been awesome
hiking,oh wow what a gem
hiking,please don t feed the wildlife if you aren t familiar with leave no trace it s an important part of responsibly enjoying the outdoors
hiking,man i am definitely looking into that asap lol
hiking,yes the trail is still under some construction
hiking,hell yeah my favorite thing is hiking with my pup so i can appreciate it get yourself some good shoes if you ever do some longer hikes your feet will thank you
hiking,of course there an entree fee to the park itself but there are lots of pull offs along the park where you can park and pop in if you go through the park office you can rent a for maybe and do some sand boarding though so definitely keep that in mind
hiking,this pic inspires me so much i just lost toes and part of my foot i have been stressing about being able to hike as well
hiking,thank you for the suggestions made it to the valley of fire briefly on my last trip but barely scratched the surface really looking forward to getting back and traversing more of it
hiking,almost looks like big sur
hiking,please resumit again but use the proper title format your text most specific place specific place general place country
hiking,oh thank you i ll check those out we re considering around rio juan national forest means a bit more driving though
hiking,yeah i was thinking it might be more crowded than other areas in co being closer to denver maybe we ll try a little further southwest thanks
hiking,i did trail racing and for hiking i still use trail runners whenever i can the boots are still necessary for climbing scree snow and slush but otherwise i still prefer the lightness and comfort and breathing of the shoes even on some climbs we wear runners to do the approach i start with the shoes and see how it goes then get boots if you need them especially since there is even more variety in boots than trail runners as for the hiking if you have terrain like ours you did plenty of walking on your runs on the steep bits so you should be good to go the difference is adjusting to longer times out vs ground covered so more water consumed maybe need for food etc a big pack is a pain and downhills esp with it are ugh but you accommodate to it poles help
hiking,yo that s pretty
hiking,is this hope bc looks spectacular
hiking,i been lucky i had to self arrest in the a couple of times that tightened my sphincter a little bit but it went wrong because of me i been at for a while and have been safe otherwise because i try to think things through did come around a turn once off trail and a wildfire had started on a too close ridge had to take a second to see how it was moving before i started to move that was a little trippy fire is alive
hiking,nice
hiking,i most definitely will my ol lady has decided that we are doing this once a week so i m sure we ll go there soon
hiking,thank you i shall do that
hiking,just added that to my ever growing list haha i ve never seen sandunes before super excited to check them out d much appreciated for the info

hiking,check out the collegiate peaks and mount princeton hot springs for a slightly less crowded but equally beautiful area for camping and hiking in co

hiking,helmet
hiking,got ta get it before the snow comes in today
hiking,badass
hiking,i had mine for a short while you can download offline maps with a max ratio of km after that it works very well it will show you your route while walking you can zoom in and out easily via the buttons and the screen is bright enough to watch on sunlight i very happy with it
hiking,lol it not important anymore awww wow thanks i going to have to go and check it out
hiking,it s hard af to squat like that you were making it look easy
hiking,hahaha maybe we passed each other we ran into a bunch of em on highline and hidden lake trails
hiking,haha no worries but now i m really curious what you thought i meant since it seemed to come across offensive glt is a on for who travel the the logo the founder uses in photos haha
hiking,right me myself and that all we got
hiking,omg that is not what i thought you meant lol so sorry i new to reddit i have never heard of the group actually
hiking,was curious if this was a reference to the group girls love travel
hiking,i do think there is one to the top of that one you can go down to the lake and the trail i was on goes up to the glacier
hiking,you won t be disappointed
hiking,ahhh i might try that the next time i there
hiking,me myself and irene
hiking,this was about the halfway mark or about miles in i glacier is further up and the total one way hike is about miles
hiking,rrg is a hidden gem glad you re all safe
hiking,yeah it is a busy place especially in the middle of summer but still worth to visit
hiking,yikes that sounds just as scary if not more to me
hiking,wait is the inca trail now open
hiking,i must i will nature always lifts my spirits
hiking,yeah it s not to far i did this hike during my trip to zion on the drive back actually it s super short you should also check out coral pink sands it s also not far from zion
hiking,look at those people on the bridge so many people
hiking,absolutely enjoyable in small doses
hiking,goodness gracious that s scary when we hiked snowdon in the uk during winter we witnessed somebody trip slip and very nearly go right over the precipice because of ice my heart stopped but they managed to grab onto the rock
hiking,not so much during the winter season because of snow and travel but summer gets packed however that is just like every other national park to be packed in the summer they say if you wan na beat traffic and people to have a place either in the park or a little outside of it
hiking,beautiful i hitting the west rim trail in weeks how was the water flowing for refills
hiking,it was beautifulllll
hiking,my husband and i were super happy on this trip go out and have an adventure promise it will take your worries away
hiking,forreal
hiking,this one may seem benign but it was an inches from death situation we were in red river gorge ky at gray arch it was early spring and there were still a lot of icicles on the cliffs my son and i went over to where a row of them were dripping on the ground and i said to not go any closer than about feet because you have no idea how big that ice is or when they may break off we looked up for a few moments then backed away when we were about feet back of those icicles fell to the rocks with an impact that felt like a motor vehicle had just been dropped off the cliff it was about a foot drop and the impact would been fatal had we lingered a step closer to where we were do not underestimate ice on a cliff
hiking,this was taken right after the snowstorm they had last month
hiking,yesssss

hiking,went in the fall highly recommend
hiking,ahhh it just hit me its years since my magic trip here man this last year felt so slow to experience but went so quick in retrospect
hiking,i wish i would be talented enough to paint this view
hiking,me didn t join today jokes aside nice adventure shot
hiking,the only thing this picture is missing is me in it to inhale that crisp air by the sea
hiking,indeed
hiking,it gorgeous place
hiking,looks like it could be a painting the waters hues look so inviting
hiking,this is my mindset for every hike now my goal is to be on the trail at least minutes before sunrise now so much more peaceful
hiking,did happen to me but to a friend of mine guy loves to do a lot of hiking especially off trail or little explored territory comfortable with class scrambles to get to the tops of peaks a very experienced and overall knowledgable hiker gets done doing a sketchy hike and is eating lunch decided to do the beginner level nature loop that many parks have just to stretch the legs before driving home somehow trips over a rock slides down a slight embankment and hits his head ended the day hike with a helicopter ride and a lifetime of neurological damage
hiking,yes it pretty well thawed shaded areas will still have a bit of ice but the miles we did yesterday were pretty well clear and thanks looks like they all got very compressed though
hiking,such a gorgeous view
hiking,i ve been there absolutely beautiful
hiking,i want to be happy like this
hiking,they are both satanic
hiking,no life and death situations but when i was a kid my family got lost quite a lot my father was a geography teacher and proudly believed that if there was any discrepancy between the map and the real world the map is always right
hiking,girvan
hiking,awesome photos love the dog that is one sassy looking puppy so awesome
hiking,oh wow it looks like
hiking,oh man
hiking,it s a very pretty place but go super early it s gets very crowded and many of the visitors are not respectful at all in terms of conservation leaving the trails etc
hiking,interesting first impression
hiking,i hiked to a lake in the sawtooth range lots of sections were scree and large boulders of granite surrounded the lake it was incredible on my way back i was hiking along side a steep slope when i started to hear something rolling it was fast enough that i could hear it tumbling down and big enough that i could feel it s impact on the ground i couldn t see it though it finally knocked into a tree and stopped it then the tree snapped looking up i see a tall tree begin to fall towards me it s frightening because you can t tell how tall these trees are it was a tall and narrow tree with lots of dead branches sticking out i immediately ran forward and when i knew i was in a safe place i watched it crash down it sent a large dust cloud on the trail and left me pretty shaken up at first i thought a boulder was tumbling down which is terrifying because their path is unpredictable i m still uncomfortable hiking along slopes and every time i hear a branch fall off a tree i m ready to sprint haha
hiking,it will be just this summer season plenty more before then
hiking,today actually
hiking,haha i know that feeling it sucks
hiking,i too was there in july one of my all time favorite hikes while at the glacier someone pointed out some mountain goats on the super high meadows above quite surreal
hiking,looks like ailsa craig
hiking,i thought that was a severed finger
hiking,you look so pissed at him for almost dragging you off a cliff haha
hiking,he looks so happy i used to have a pit that went hiking with us he absolutely loved it he loved swimming too does your guy like swimming
hiking,lol
hiking,what a cutie and that view is remarkable
hiking,if i get there my cellphone would be overflowed with pics that such an amazing view
hiking,thanks for that i had issues with my dog not drinking before or drinking very little even on short hikes i ca tell if she just does need much or if she refusing i try that in the future
hiking,looks like the two of you make a great team
hiking,i was sleeping under the stars on the appalachian trail and another group of hikers came into our camp they told us that a few nights before they were sleeping out in the open and a rabid fox attacked them it walked right past their dog and chomped on one of their group s hands breaking several bones i haven t slept out of a tent since
hiking,i hike in moss rock preserve too and it seems to be the cool thing to let your dog run around off leash drives me crazy and i do hike there as much because of it if you local give red mountain park a try too
hiking,how was the temperature during the night last time i returned at the camp site where not so far from the peak pity
hiking,yosemite is one of the greatest places on earth we hiked cloud s rest when we were there and it was one of the greatest experiences of my life enjoy

hiking,between deet and picardin which last longer and leaves less of a layer on your skin both mix with sunscreen the sunscreen and mixing of bug repellent always throws me off

hiking,good job man the doggo looks out of this world happy made me smile
hiking,i always think these breeds have such nice faces keep on hiking man
hiking,this is the upper waterfall of the escondido falls trail it took about minutes of some scrambling and climbing after the first fall but it was worth it i first went up alone since some of our group couldn t make it all the way checked it out myself though and then came back with a few others very cool to have found a path leading into the fall itself
hiking,this is the upper waterfall of the escondido falls trail it took about minutes of some scrambling and climbing after the first fall but it was worth it i first went up alone since some of our group couldn t make it all the way checked it out myself though and then came back with a few others very cool to have found a path leading into the fall itself

hiking,go early pay extra for transportation in the park if you don t already have shuttle tickets visit the outfitters if you re going to hike into wall street in the narrows rent the gear it s worth it all the instagram crowd will be in the beginning of the trail so it s crowded the deeper you go the more glorious it gets bring water and snacks for fuel you will need the energy on the return happy hiking
hiking,does rocky mountain very crowded thinking of driving out there this summer
hiking,beautiful and some pretty scenery too
hiking,looks like a great time also strong squat game
hiking,i m so glad you both enjoyed i walk a pound dog clicker training then treat training has helped a lot have so much fun hiking it rules
hiking,i ll be there next month any tips for the narrows
hiking,yeah well it i sure it would have been more popular if it was buried in six feet of snow and warmer than degrees lol
hiking,awesome shots
hiking,only lucky you trillium often has keep right signs seriously
hiking,this past weeks i m not sure just plan on snow but mostly supportive spring snow
hiking,beautiful hike and beautiful person
hiking,it was cold but i rented the shoes socks and waiters for the hike worth every penny it doesn t keep you completely dry but close enough the biggest boost were the shoes for gripping the rocks they are very slick i fell once when i slipped and the current caught me as fell back into the water it was a beautiful and rugged hike for me hours and that was only half way and back
hiking,vasque summit gtx
hiking,nice pictures i hope you two had fun it looks like the pup was enjoying himself
hiking,i ve seen their tracks all around the mountain except on the west flank but i ve not been on the west side in the snow
hiking,you won t be disappointed
hiking,breathtaking
hiking,colorado rocky mountain high i had to
hiking,a sweet pupper is a gear hiking partner so happy
hiking,not making it there this june like we had hoped definitely next year it s gorgeous
hiking,there is a scramble to the top of mount gould on your picture the one in the middle in the background with a stellar view on the glacier and icing on the cake you can enjoy paradise solitude up there
hiking,i did it two weeks ago and it was degrees and chest deep in places
hiking,did this couple weeks ago since i couldn t bike one of the top moments of my life
hiking,the answers in this duplicate post are better
hiking,best site along the whole trek imo hope you enjoyed
hiking,c est vraiment la belle province
hiking,is there a trail leading up that mountain just beside the lake
hiking,i d kill to be back in the pnw
hiking,i get that just looking for a general area to be a little bit more vigilant mount hood wilderness badger creek wilderness
hiking,he seems so happy to be there with you glad you enjoyed
hiking,it up just outside of bailey very nice trail
hiking,buffalo mountain in summit county will have to check out rosalie trail soon
hiking,from last june old pictures just felt like sharing
hiking,my only encounter has been over at ives run i was hiking the midstate trail and it was wildly over grown you could even see them all i heard was hissing and i just took off running blindly hoping for the best
hiking,love it there
hiking,this is great haha
hiking,so was that the end of your hike
hiking,been spending a lot of time up there the last few summers last trip i went on i think we counted stopping at around lakes on a day trip
hiking,going in november ca wait
hiking,glacial and alpine snowmelt lakes are so beautiful the color is stunning
hiking,i like that idea
hiking,when was this taken my buddy and i are planning on hiking a leg of the pct just a little north of mt hood closer to the gorge making a loop to indian springs trail in a couple weeks curious for the sake of snow depth as well as running into a kitty
hiking,that sounds good i will check
hiking,that good to hear i only bumped in to other people more than half a mile part the entrance gate so i was worried there could be predators around
hiking,devil horns peace sign
hiking,beef lung
hiking,i plan on i do like heights but force myself to do things anyways it will take me a week to recover haha
hiking,we will never tell you where the cameras are sorry trillium is more crowded than most city parks the big cats won t hang out there
hiking,is this anywhere near trillium lake i hiked out to it with my dogs when i was visiting from la last week and kept them on the trail and near by they wanted to run around in the woods but i was nervous about it for exactly this reason
hiking,i love to do this hike someday i lived in santa fe for years but i could find the time to get away much for trips around the region
hiking,in the las vegas area a day trip to valley of fire and the arizona hot springs hike would be my recommendations bring plenty of water and be aware of the weather
hiking,backpacking from the valley is punishing starting at glacier point skips a lot of elevation gain and crowds even better if you hike out to the valley as a car shuttle or hitchhike with that much vertical i would do it as a day hike and backpack somewhere else away from the crowds
hiking,we never say where are cameras are they have disappeared
hiking,new mexico is so pretty
hiking,rock on
hiking,nice man i always picture utah hiking as always being orange and desert like scenery so it was cool seeing all this greenery

hiking,if you want to backpack in you can start at tuolumne meadows and spend a couple days hiking down to the half dome spur trail do the climb and then hike down to the valley then you do have to do all that climbing in one day too but it will take about days total i not sure if your permit covers all that though

hiking,northern pakistan fairy meadows
hiking,pakistan was a pretty big tourist destination in the century however and the subsequent war on terror plunged it into chaos the terrorist attacks and taliban that people normally associate with the country are almost pretty much dead after the army launched operations against them in and the country reputation is now slowly growing back it was ranked as the tourist destination in the world in and it has seen a increase in tourism from the years before it important to note that gilgit the most beautiful province of the country and where this photo was never dangerous even when the nation was in the war on terror it remained isolated from the country problems
hiking,we have done this twice it s the best day hike ever and we have done hikes in nps take water and more water especially in august yes gloves are essential and start before dawn it s a torturous hike but so rewarding have fun
hiking,cool thanks i ve got some salomon poles that i ve used before i currently have a blackwolf backpack litres i think i can t actually conceptualise what litres converts to in packing size for tent i was thinking something light but good for cold weather budget wise i think i ll buy stuff overtime but getting the essentials for under would be good is that reasonable
hiking,aw man that makes me wistful for my days living in raleigh i hiked that trail weekly for years been on that boardwalk dozens of times
hiking,it has to be on a hiker bucket list for sure
hiking,hands down this and highline are a hiker paradise we saw a mama bear and cubs right at the trailhead
hiking,also shoes or rather books currently i run in hokas and was planning to use them for multi day hikes but a lot of people are telling me to get proper boots i could tell you oodles of information about trail running shoes but wouldn t know where to start when it comes to boots any tips on a good place to start researching boots that might suit if you got the ankle for trailrunning multi day hikes in hours i guarantee that you will have no issues backpacking in those same shoes maybe consider trekking poles though they help take stress off your knees with heavier loads i only backpack in hoka speedgoats they are great also what is your budget for a pack sleep system and tent are you looking to keep it pretty lightweight
hiking,amazing view
hiking,no problem take lots of pictures and do the cables even if you re nervous i had no idea what i was getting into and didn t mentally prepare for that
hiking,thanks man that is exactly the info i was looking for
hiking,is the hike back a day trek too or are there buses like right near the machu picchu grounds
hiking,i hiked half dome a couple years ago without preparing went with buddies who ended up having tickets and got to the cables and freaked out i didn t have proper shoes or any gloves definitely bring a second pair of shoes in your pack that have a good grip for when you get to the cables you re going to be on slick granite also bring textured gloves to hold the cables lots of water and food but that s really it the hike is long and there are huge granite steps near the cables that were super difficult i made it but wished i had better training for my legs at that point you have hiked a lot of miles and then you have to do these huge steps have fun
hiking,just did the same thing on rosalie trail where were you guys
hiking,a very exhausted hiker wearing the proper outfit
hiking,i couldn t even imagine hiking at that altitude you guys must be very fit well conditioned kudos it honestly sounds like quite the adventure and cheers to many more for you yours

hiking,that bus route is brutal don t beat yourself up for wanting to avoid it we hiked to machu picchu then took the bus down to aguas calientes to catch the train back to cusco i was extremely nervous every time we went around a switchback
hiking,i like the one with the llama next to the person
hiking,hope you make it in
gardening,so cool
gardening,i have a few more containers but this is the first one that popped up
gardening,maybe needs repotting in new soil
gardening,oh no you or your neighbor need to sever the root install a rhizome barrier deep i wanted to plant some bamboo this is one of the reasons i its difficult to contain the other reason i did is bc it attracts rats
gardening,gorgeous collection
gardening,the frog has melted into the banana plant
gardening,could you elaborate on the soil everything ive seen has advised to prune the tomato plants of everything except the top branches and plant deep so the generate more roots
gardening,looks kind of like a dandelion to me
gardening,provide it with the soil it grows in naturally peat bogs you need to dig a hole three times the width of the root ball put the blueberry plant in the middle and mix in peat and black earth blueberries hate sandy soil they want a soil high in organic matter that also is quite acidic no sandy soil for blueberries they hate it you can supplement with acidifier mixed with well rotted compost over time
gardening,i call them blue jays but they are probably bluebirds no crest we had a cat once and every time he would go outside this jay would dive bomb him it got really bad
gardening,snakes love my garden too
gardening,tomatoes i start at minutes in the sun and then add minutes for the next few days and then go for hours within about a week to days you should be able to have them out for hours no problem this leaf might have gotten a bit burned it no problem as your new growth looks really good you do need to get that plant in the ground in the next few days or repot it in a bigger container you going to be severely root bound already and that will stress the plant as much as too much sun when hardening off
gardening,i thought marigolds attracts wasps which hunt aphids maybe they act as a decoy too
gardening,it could be from cold damage was there recent snow in your area
gardening,thanks everyone i do know why i bother labelling these when i get it so wrong haha alright now i confused are there pepper plant varieties that look like tomatoes but do have the tomato plant smell because i have what i was pretty sure were pepper plants growing they look almost identical to tomato plants with the little hairs minus the tomato smell
gardening,my hollyhock just flowered for the first time is it going to be this tall
gardening,bell pepper
gardening,she will love that what the plant in the middle it lovely i love the color
gardening,keep updating
gardening,this is awesome
gardening,if you are planting in a bucket do put soil up to the top instead leave a few inches to add mulch on top that way you can help the tomato plant fight off some of the heat that would cook it inside a bucket your mulch also protects the soil from sun and water damage of nutrients in your soil
gardening,i definitely go into the zone when i weeding but i have headphones on with lots of metal so i do go too far under although the music makes it own zone too if it hot out do bother talking to me because i am far away edit to add i actually like weeding i on my hands and knees and i can see just how the plants are doing and i get close up viewing of the bees in action
gardening,wow we grew some for the first time last year near chicago and they never got this tall phoenix weather will do that i guess i wish mine got this tall
gardening,ok in my garden i don t like thistles they are considered a to me would you admit that a thistle is a living organism
gardening,it would be quite a beautifully diverse community you would ve moved into if you were surrounded by thousands of iraqis but i guess irises are the next best thing did the former owners leave any plant markers labels or landscaping plans so you can id the cultivars these are
gardening,no my strawberries are blooming too i get spring and fall berries
gardening,if they are first year strawberries you can cut some of the flowers before they bear fruit reason cutting the flowers stimulate more growth in the strawberry plant itself so that you can get a better harvest for years of the plant if you do cut the flowers the energy will be dedicated to fruit production and you will have a smaller plant for the rest of its growth cycle yes there are exceptions to this and this is mainly for june bearing strawberry plants
gardening,i have found the same info i was hoping you could teach me your ways haha
gardening,i was so thrilled to see my hollyhocks are coming back but nothing like this i so jealous
gardening,happens all the time id let them mature a bit before separating once a set of true leaves develop gently slide a spoon normal cereal spoon a few inches below the surface next to the seedlings and scoop them out you can separate and bury just to below the leaves
gardening,thanks for the tips i m going to add posts to the end of my raised bed to tie string for support any idea how high i should make the posts
gardening,def pepper
gardening,it is definitely a pepper plant
gardening,day man whaaaoohh
gardening,very slick beetlejuicing cook smooch
gardening,i think it s a pepper
gardening,they do like to be in moist soil as they are closely related to marsh mallows
gardening,anything labeled potting soil should be fine definitely plant per bucket variety tomatoes would be happiest in containers varieties will keep growing as big as possible and find the edge of those pots quickly
gardening,urine is known to contain a wide range of viruses
gardening,pesticide noun a substance used for destroying insects or other organisms harmful to cultivated plants or to animals herbicide noun a substance that is toxic to plants used to destroy unwanted vegetation honestly grade english was not that hard for everyone else and let me know when you get every dictionary on the plant to change their definition along with every intuition of agricultural research and education on the planet
gardening,i would say not great but if you do want to try to save them i would pull them out of the current container they are in and put them in fresh warm dry potting soil and then put them somewhere room temp or warmer and water very sparingly sounds a little crazy to unpot them and change out the soil but it worked for me as a rescue effort before good luck
gardening,love the mural love the garden
gardening,i am the opposite i despise weeding so much that i taken a gardener to help me weed every few weeks
gardening,they are not thriving they are leggy stretching for light they need better lighting or an added light
gardening,looks comfy
gardening,some of the colors are amazing my big one from last year blooms a mix of bright pink and dark purple at first i thought it was multiple plants in the container but i get the mixed blooms on the same stem so it is apparently just awesome like that last year s fuchsia this was originally a hanging basket i moved it into a big square pot and it is growing new leaves right now i can t wait until it blooms again
gardening,i could be wrong but it just looks like hard water rub one leaf with your fingers to remove it it should come back and then you can do the rest if it comes back you can curse me then sorry
gardening,got to
gardening,was this from a tree transplanted into the ground or a seed you sprouted from a store bought avocado i guessing the former years is awesome would love to see how many you get next year
gardening,thanks i had another one named bridget but they left after only a cm or so deep into another post haha
gardening,yup they definitely reach for the sun so pot rotation will help if you really worried get two tall sticks and tie it up between them
gardening,guess you need to start feeding them more bananas
gardening,try adding up nutrients to the garden soil
gardening,shit it looks like it got to at the lowest last night you might be right and they froze what the chances of them perking up at this point
gardening,i not a big time gardener in any way so that may be lol you could use some type of strap around the bottom sort of how trash bags sometimes have the cinch strap you can put around the outside of the trash can or a length of metal rod laid on top of the netting but inside the edge of the raised bed so that anything getting in would have to lift the rod easy for you tough for rodents
gardening,thanks i really liking these autumnal ferns zone btw
gardening,oh beautiful
gardening,it seems pepper
gardening,it s a little fairy garden that my kids are growing some little plants in got it at barnes and noble
gardening,single plant in a bucket is good idea
gardening,i kind of like the bins and how they are color coordinated with the house made me chuckle
gardening,that looks like a lovely space
gardening,yeah i was very genuinely surprised that we got two fruits off of this tree after only two years even with it being a grafted tree as most avocados are i thought i would be waiting at least another year or two at minimum
gardening,no don t cut it now is the time for blooms let it be
gardening,good for u got a
gardening,does your maybe neighbor spray something on them to keep critters away deer really like to eat hydrangeas in my yard but plenty of my neighbors still grow them without issue i expect that many of them use sprays

gardening,i pitched the idea of a squirrel catapult to return them to my neighbour that feeds them and the goffers rabbits birds anyone with design plans
gardening,came out of a catalog wouldn t recommend it to be honest started falling apart after a year
gardening,i love this
gardening,wow this is so awesome i would normally associate hollyhocks with an english cottage so its nice to see it in a place like that
gardening,i pour enough water in the tray to come up slightly less than halfway up the sides of the containers they should float i let them sit there until i see the soil surface starting to darken then pull them the extra water i do time it but it can take a while depending on how dry they are i say on average it maybe takes around minutes for a tray pots take longer than the little cells do
gardening,looks like a bit of cold damage if the soil is as dry as it looks maybe give it a bit of compost to retain moisture better
gardening,i jealous
gardening,anyways this stuff is working great on the creeping violet star of bethlehem so i completely recommend it for addressing common lawn weeds to the detriment of your local pollinator populations which is why your post was so thoroughly downvoted
gardening,mmmm myes froge squishe
gardening,thank you so much for the suggestion i will do that what was your soil deficient in
gardening,may
gardening,a normal winter storm we could handled but this was unprecedented it got to here in sw louisiana the coldest its gotten in decades we are still recovering from the hurricanes here and majority of my plants had to be kept outside between my house and my sisters house is in the middle of remodel and plants would been in the way of the work crew some are starting to come back some are complete losses my variegated bougainvillea has shown any signs of recovery its all woody and hollow i lost all my orchids and numerous other house plants

gardening,make sure to eat your cat food drink your beer and sniff your glue before bed so you can wake up early and get out to the garden
gardening,lol hilarious
gardening,we re not at that level yet but hopefully soon yes got ta keep a close eye on them
gardening,that seems like too much soil moisture combined with cold temps to me what have your nighttime temps been like usually too much sun exposure presents as bleached spots on the leaves not darkening of the plant
gardening,looks great there are some great cinder block layouts and aquaponic layouts to take advantage of the vertical space if you looking to add some more production to your space
gardening,that got ta be some kind of pepper
gardening,have you hardened them off gradually acclimated them to the outdoors if you do harden them off first they will have a bad time
gardening,fellow moringa grower could you help me out every time i grow these they do great until about the three week mark then they turn yellow and die maybe less water or fertilizer seems lmcruel to germinate them only to kill them a few weeks later
gardening,if anyone wants to see go out of their way to hurt a fellow vegan mourning the loss of her fisherman brother check out the link below
gardening,i love that this is slowly becoming a iasip meme sub lmao

gardening,i had an avocado tree in my backyard where i grew up it was at least to years old it produced some of the best avocados i ve ever eaten someone in the future will give thanks to you for the great avocados mine were fuerte avocados they were giant three of them would barely fit on a inch dinner plate
gardening,they are capable of receiving a tremendous amount of power
gardening,pretty flowers if you can add the pic to our community desertrose
gardening,saying that people are dying and i want to stop that is an appeal to emotion how do you think that someone questioning the necessity of gmos somehow leads to people dying the costs of a delay can be substantial a one year delay in approval of the resistant cowpea in nigeria will cost the country about million usd to million usd and between and lives when it comes to gmo food crops campaigners have thus won a remarkable yet dubious victory they have not prevented rich countries from using gmo animal feed or gmo cotton yet farmers and consumers in poor countries need increased productivity for food crops not animal feed or industrial crops today de facto global ban on gmo food crops therefore looks suspiciously like an outcome designed by the rich and for the rich with little regard for the interests of the poor controlling for other factors the adoption of gm cotton has significantly improved calorie consumption and dietary quality resulting from increased family incomes this technology has reduced food insecurity by among households gm crops alone will not solve the hunger problem but they can be an important component in a broader food security strategy nbsp you are questioning the necessity you buying into literal corporate propaganda the ewg is remotely credible because their positions regularly ignore scientific fact funny how your article quotes gary hirshberg but neglects to mention his other job
gardening,oh that so pretty
gardening,i didn t even know these could be variegated now i have to go find me one
gardening,and charlie
gardening,i usually amend with black cow compost organic tomato tone blood meal and fish meal i ll start to use fish liquid fertilizer after a month or so and add more tomato tone later in the season
gardening,no harm doing so
gardening,hiss
gardening,i about to transfer my very first seedlings tuesday and i real nervous i basically planted seeds and let them grow in starting soil for about weeks now turns out i done almost everything wrong with them hour grow lights watering from top sowed in egg carton on the plus side i prepared a decent raised bed with lumber it a simple single layer bed plant soil one old bag of peat and lots of topsoil from around my fire pit tips or wishing of luck is appreciated i having fun but i worried ill kill my plants
gardening,i see no alligators
gardening,what of the potential biohazard aspects though at work is meaning ppe up to extreme levels due to the risk of pathogens
gardening,this looks like my garden last year turned out to be a soil deficiency i had to buy a test kit from amazon and test the soil to figure it out i hear you can get your local county to do the same thing i would recommend a test kit that way you know precisely what s going on once i amended my soil the plants all took off with growth and fruit
gardening,yeah that s really good advice even though last frost is typically first week of may it s better to wait weeks especially for tomatoes
gardening,my heart aches for all of the plants that were hit with freak winter and spring cold temps we been lucky here low temps but not too damaging
gardening,what did you use for amendment all these years tomato plants need more potassium and iron compared to others so general fertilizer or compost wo do it for them in the long run
gardening,this is the first time i seen something like this in our yard wonder if a seed blew in from elsewhere
gardening,you need to mimic winter a process called stratification
gardening,hello i am growing some golden sweet snow peas and magnolia blossom tendril peas and the plants are quite young they first sprouted april and in the past week they went from looking pretty to looking like something is wrong here are some pictures golden sweet snow peas magnolia blossom tendril peas you ll probably notice some bugs have been eating them i think slugs i m trying to deal with that if it looks like something else though please let me know otherwise i m mostly concerned about the yellowing particularly of the golden sweets they seem to be getting more and more yellow and i m worried it s fusarium wilt i think my magnolia blossoms are losing their green too but they don t look as bad as the golden sweets in person i d love to get a second opinion since i m pretty new to gardening i really don t want to have to throw out all my peas
gardening,you have to go to a proper nursery and pay the price which if you buy during the bare root season is often lower then the price of potted trees at big stores
gardening,i am so happy she survive the polar vortex my rio samba was so lucky on to buy my one if i can find it
gardening,big dumb bird
gardening,looks like some variety of oxalis
gardening,here s hoping it happens i m planning a yard sale this weekend have to get rid of crap so i have room for more plants
gardening,yep one of the reasons i love it fills in holes in the garden with like zero work attracts bees that pollinate my veggies
gardening,our tomato was doing so great ughhhhh
gardening,some seeds have a need to be cold so as to trigger germination spinach is a classic example and i have had almost no luck growing spinach in florida
gardening,well it sunny today but kinda cold so i improvised a mini greenhouse due to low temperature
gardening,how do i get this video as a zoom background
gardening,your garden looks awesome btw enjoy the soils edit spoils not soils lol gardening puns just come naturally to me i guess
gardening,calla lily
gardening,mulch is better than rocks rocks do prevent weeds as over time they accumulate dirt on top of them in which weeds grow anyway mulches break down over time and feed the entire soil biota not just the trees before you buy a lot of mulch check with the city to make sure that you even required to do so the roses are what known as guerilla gardening someone tiptoed in and planted them snow per se does damage roses it the polar vortex that winterkills them it the zone temperatures coupled with wind
gardening,i have seen some plants do grow well in cars with the help of cats
gardening,the concrete itself is porous and water will seep through though if it d seep through fast enough to allow proper drainage for plants is debatable i suppose erring on the side of caution i d knock a small hole through one end maybe i don t think drilling is necessary as concrete bits aren t cheap and they take time if you don t have a dedicated rotohammer a simple cold chisel and hammer should effectively make quick work of chipping off a corner to allow additional drainage you could always try filling it with water first and see how long it takes to seep through the concrete
gardening,i do have any more seeds unfortunately i have the blinds open and a plant light over them all day so i not sure how to give them better light
gardening,yeah i have been told that a backyard avocado that is allowed to really let the fruit mature is much better than a grocery store avocado this was definitely better than some of the dense watery tasting avocados i have had from the store but i also live in avocado country so sometimes the stores do have good relatively local fruit that is quite nice so i was a little disappointed as i expected more from it again i do think they will get better when the tree is larger i still have one more on there that i am going to leave a little longer and pick as well to see if there is a difference
gardening,if it s not putting out many leaves then it can not support a trunk volume that large so i d say if it s a quite sparse leaves wise every summer then you could really hack away a good foot from the top otherwise if it is covered in leaves you might just leave it to build up a healthy root system do you ve any pics of it in leaf by chance
gardening,yup not the prettiest but it s a garden on a budget
gardening,my last frost is in may godspeed
gardening,we had an unexpected but expected freeze and despite covering them with plastic and everything my tomatoes threw a fit and are close to death on the other hand my beans lettuce peppers watermelon cucumber zucchini perilla squash okra and corn are all doing great those poor tomatoes i going to check on them after work to see if they still live
gardening,not sure about squirrels but the red rock thing works for certain birds you have to put them out before the real berries come up they peck em and lose interest then you get to keep your haul some birds are too smart though
gardening,made by hard plants for hard plants
gardening,they are stretching for light they re going to get too tall and then flip over and die if it were me i would start over with a much stronger light
gardening,boop the snoot boop the snoot
gardening,ooof that s a lot of work
gardening,you could make a nice sandwich with the little guy
gardening,things that go directly on top of the leach field need to be carefully supervised and chosen but you can certainly put a border around the edge of the leach field do not add any more soil on top of the leach field
gardening,hello from deerfield nh
gardening,lol you not wrong
gardening,i need a new watering can anyway thank you very much i will definitely look into a feed tank for the future the drip irrigation is a big undertaking for me the green thumb does come naturally lol
gardening,awesome just interested in the difference as you never know what real good tastes like until you grow it
gardening,carrots radishes and chives potatoes cilantro and onion all of those are fine when in the garden anyway so the lack of equipment is a those all benefit from cool moist weather which in your location is found in spring and fall except for the potatoes which go all summer they burn out when things start to heat up in july and august if you far enough north you have a slightly different schedule than south as your july and august may not be as hot as mine are the county extension office is a better source for a more specific planting schedule than the almanac which is necessarily somewhat general if you going to grow tomatoes and peppers you need lights or buy plants but everything else and that includes the warm season crops like cukes zukes squash pumpkins corn and beans are direct seeded too once the soil not the air has warmed to at least
gardening,i ve heard that it s good to trim new growth so the plant can direct all resources to existing branches while the tree is developing any advice is appreciated
gardening,they grow better outside doesn t look like you have a convertible hard to get enough light in there jk obviously good luck with the trees
gardening,sometimes they do it because they thirsty try leaving them some water in another part of the yard
gardening,i know blue jays can be jerks and blue birds can be territorial with each other but i did know bluebirds would mob people to get them away from their nests
gardening,best things is sharing produce with everyone the freaking deer i babysat a tulip all week waiting to see the pretty flower went out there today and someone ate it down to the ground booooo

gardening,it not that toxic your soil is not poisoned it does not require remediation and your plants are in no danger tobacco and its products such as nicotine is not plutonium cobalt lead or mercury it totally a relax i not sure where you got the idea that it that toxic as if it was an industrial chemical like pcbs or dioxin or a heavy metal or radioactive put them in the ordinary kitchen waste trash there are no plants that will suck up or uptake nicotine which breaks down in the soil fairly quickly anyway with natural processes there are no toxins in your basement that will affect your plants and any residual effects from smoke that would affect you not your plants dissipates as soon as the smoker stops smoking in there really you have a complete here allow me to reassure you what you can grow in your basement is determined by how much light you have i ca help you with needing to get in there and access it for maintenance while there an abusive and aggressive person in the room but i strongly suggest that you just not try to grow anything down there there are no plants that will suck up the toxins his smoking is generating or has generated
gardening,it gets better and better every year
gardening,lmfao this helped me smile lol
gardening,my cats ate all of mine before i could get them outside only the cayenne was spared i feel your pain had to restart
gardening,doing the same thing with my daughter dandelions and daisy chains
gardening,ok thanks i didn t know that i m doing some googling and i think it ll be best to give it it s own pot i did notice the plants around it not growing as fast recently
gardening,along with tying it up which i see you did you could try rotating it to were the sunlight is only hitting one side of it so then it start stretching more upright
gardening,one
gardening,the bottom half definitely woke up but the top has remained the same for weeks since it started budding
gardening,does anyone know why my indoor ficus tree looks like this it seems like it sap but it is runny anything i should do about it to keep it from getting on everything
gardening,so i started these plants two weeks ago and some have just started to fold over like this i not sure what i doing wrong too much or not enough water they going to be planted outside but there are some thunderstorms and fluctuating temperatures that i worried about so i still waiting could they be getting too big for the area and not getting enough nutrients i never taken care of these before just thought they were neat and wanted to give them a try thought i was doing great when they popped up so fast
gardening,father called them sh those flowers because back in his youth they were common around the outdoor facilities
gardening,you are right there are a couple random rose bushes that someone planted i thought they would die this winter with all the snow but they actually came back i think they look kind of silly being randomly planted in the corners of each box sounds best to just get some mulch from the garden store then is mulch better for the tree or should we go with rocks
gardening,i have no idea what it is but i love it i been seeing all the weed posts in this subreddit and i was so jealous most of my weeds do look pretty
gardening,i did i pinched them back and they definitely bushier should i prune more
gardening,bonsai is better but you do need to bonsai are really treated like normal plants when it gets rootbound and ca take nutrients then you can replant but you do need to keep increasing the size of the pot
gardening,my mil called me tuesday morning and asked if i wanted any trees apparently my fil ordered a bunch and she was going to pick them up i had been looking at trees or bushes to put in our backyard so i said sure and this is what i got according to the tags tulip trees the larger ones red maple chokecherry american redbud plus unidentified small shrub i purchased soil mulch and some tree fertilizer spikes i saw recommended online but i not entirely sure what else i should be doing do they need any sort of support after they planted does anyone have any pro tips or recommendations on best practices for planting or care i never owned a home before and i certainly have never taken care of trees hah we be planting these this weekend sometime depending on weather thanks in advance
gardening,find someone with some in their yard and offer to buy some from them they likely either tell you to fuck off or give you some without expecting payment
gardening,fairly erratic i live in north florida and it has gone from degrees to degrees over a hour period a few times since i planted them in march
gardening,that s strange i was weeding last season s veggie patch and about half of the crop survived the winter it s spring now and that never happens in zone i was just talking to my mom about that also
gardening,did it taste good
gardening,gosh i wish i lived where someone was giving away free marble well yes it will totally work and you be well placed to your neighbors d oh that just my solid marble garden bed lol a raised bed just needs to be something to hold a big pile of soil in place so the rain does wash it away you can use anything tree limbs cinder blocks old bricks empty filled with sand marble is a lot classier than gallon milk jugs
gardening,any ideas what could be happening here google indicated it could be herbicide damage roundup or iron deficiency i don t use roundup so it would have had to drift into my yard but no other plants showing anything like this just some of the tomatoes could it be iron deficiency i amended my soil this year as i do every year which has given me massive harvests but not sure if something can happen with it over time to affect iron any idea how to tell what it could be should i try adding some iron only amendment keep or remove the yellowing leaves otherwise they re growing great minus the random dip into the we just had thanks for any help or suggestions
gardening,fuk yea
gardening,i going to keep them in the sun until they sprout
gardening,love it mine last about mid summer until the santa ana s bream them but i think i just need to plant a forest
gardening,sad mangoe
gardening,is that just plastic wrap for packing
gardening,i would put the containers in the sun for a while caladiums in the deep south only need shade once the weather starts to heat up it the hot burning sun they ca take if you still having cool spring sun i have them in the sun warm soil will help them to sprout and the sun is the easiest way to warm up the soil unless you want to bring the pots into the house
gardening,i have an enormous tall pecan tree in my yard of my adjacent neighbors also have ft pecan trees you would think yje squirrels would have plenty of nuts to leave my garden alone but instead they like to use my garden to dig their nuts and sometimes they take a little treat for the road
gardening,could you rent one of these by the hour it would save my back and knees a ton
gardening,here it awesome we still get a coolish winter so the plants that need cold are also viable
gardening,interesting cool to know thanks
gardening,if that does look like sleepy contentment i do know what does
gardening,yeah that a street tree habitat designed to host one tree per planter it not really intended to be filled with other plants too if you look on google images under things like urban tree street planters about half the people that have them opt for the design choice of tree mulch and omit anything else reasons if you put a mass planting of petunias or ivy or something in there then they need to be whereas mulch can simply be dumped to prevent weeds for the benefit of the tree itself additional plantings are murder for collecting windblown trash and cigarette butts all those candy wrappers and mcds bags and soda cups have to be pulled out by hand by someone earning x number of dollars per hour to do so the trees have an uphill survival battle as it is with restricted root room and water and nutrients availability they do really need additional competition those i believe may technically be the property of the city or other municipality same as the sidewalk they may cede maintenance of them to the property owner adjoining the sidewalk but they ultimately bear the responsibility for what growing in them i see i guess a couple of roses they will not do well in the what with competition for light nutrients and water come back in years and see snow plows are also murder on planters in big blizzards the kind of weather event where people mark their parking places with lawn chairs the streetside planters can have plenty of salty slushy snow heaped up on them the previous board did maintain the landscaping whatsoever it may not be their problem it may be the city also trees mulch does really require any debate about landscaping maintenance once a year you get a guy to dump more mulch done
gardening,months until my pumpkins are cultivating mass
gardening,there was an unexpected snow yesterday and all my seedlings are dead only my strawberry survived
gardening,mint grows wild in my backyard was there when i moved in i m not sure if it s aggressive but i will spread on its own a bit maybe a good idea to let it live by itself if you see the stop growing bigger
gardening,congrats
gardening,i did either i just got some black ones i hope they get that big too
gardening,dong
gardening,thanks it salanova lettuce normally grows like this just not used to it getting so big it lettuce grows tall like a weed it might be due to insufficient light so it trying to reach up or lack of water bolting to seed
gardening,it s been slowly getting worse during the last few weeks i have several other tomato plants that are starting to show the same symptoms just not as bad yet
gardening,oh yeah well the mint does grow really fast i can probably give it it s own container i have a mojito mint in its own pot does the container need to be large and yeah it was just cloudy when i took pics
gardening,thank you both
gardening,you got ta
gardening,i see that african milk plant we had two potted that were tall they died during the great texas blizzard
gardening,proteeeein
gardening,i do both multi headed black oil for birds bees seeds etc single stem for seeds bees something for the cardinal vine to grow up and stalk cutting for bamboo replacement
gardening,i am a major fan of bees never been stung of course so that wo be a problem at all thanks
gardening,loosen the top inch of soil with a rake or hoe prior to sowing
gardening,ik twijfelde nog of het niet toch duitsland was
gardening,but it s fun and easy to graft to this one
gardening,try some rocks at the bottom
gardening,i give you that yes invasive snakes would be the only exception
gardening,how very dare of you
gardening,zag gelijk dat het nederlands was haha
gardening,thanks for your help i ll def take do you think i should lop all the branches off and just leave the trunk and hope for the best or that s to drastic
gardening,agreed with the only exception being invasive snakes
gardening,i was gon na guess fig too but also thought those fruits were small so i plugged your photo into my app just to be sure and thank you hahaha
gardening,you should take a few cuttings and try to grow them anyway just in case it is a goner you ll still have a clone to remember it by lol other than that maybe it s not getting enough water dawn redwoods come from quite wet regions in china and can survive standing water alike the bald cypress tbh it should easily survive the cold even in ne usa as they tend to thrive there and actually experience just as fierce winters in their native habitats they will take quite a vicious pruning but i d make sure you ve a few cuttings growing before going you go crazy with the shears
gardening,this is in a planter but i can put some rich stuff on top of the current soil
gardening,drill through the bottoms of them with a cement drill bit and you ll be golden to go
gardening,drilling holes would work
gardening,weeds any unwanted plant aka a pest by definition herbicides are a type of pesticide
gardening,my neighbor use potatoes silliest damn thing i ve ever seen worked great i would be cautious about the variety there is a lot of grafting of roses onto stronger root stock either the flowering portion just isn t as vigourous or local soil types are more successful with certain root types check out a local rose club specific plant clubs are fantastic resources just be patient it tends to skew older with more out door vs on the computer time a week turn around for emails isn t unusual
gardening,it is doing alright i leave it alone at least your plant is upright mine all after the cold weather i suspect i see some leaf damage too your bleeding heart should be in shade or part sun morning it should need little supplemental watering until summer hits unless you live in a hot parched area of the earth i add inches of compost on top of the soil to encourage earthworms to tunnel up to get it this serves to aerate the soil
gardening,is there enough sunlight there looks shaded also in my experience i always put mint in its own container always seems to take over
gardening,thank you i thought maybe fig but the fruit are tiny also awesome username
gardening,mini
gardening,nah i eat my friends
gardening,if you do this for us we will bring our trusses back filled to the brim with tomatoes like a stocking
gardening,i take please
gardening,i m fully convinced the northeast us has the world s most incredible springs and falls
gardening,curtain fig is what my app says i use the picture this app on iphone if you d like to check it out
gardening,i have four dogs with free access to the back yard and the best they were able to do was occasionally bark at them but once the dogs went to bed the first couple years here i was devastated to find everything i planted destroyed finally got deer fencing to encase everything even then it took another year or so to make sure no weak spots they could get through now i like to collect deer antlers in the winter and hang them outside as a warning
gardening,nice i use hardware cloth to protect my watermelons and cantaloupe works like a charm
gardening,the key is real snakes
gardening,they are territorial they will dive bomb you if you get too close to their nest we had a special jay we called jaybird he would look in our window if he couldn t find peanuts and tap gently the neighbors hated him and his family because his nest was in their backyard as soon as they came outside he would dive bomb them
gardening,i use strawberry fields from foxfarm which is designed for fruits and flowers but it otherwise nothing fancy
gardening,if you looking to buy mature plants and trees stay away from big box stores if you looking for shrubs and you willing to put in the work and time which i assume if you on a gardening subreddit you are you should write off box stores completely the quality of the plant stock though will be dependent on the quality of staff my local lowes is actually really good the guy in the plant section is very knowledgeable and takes as much time as needed to walk people through their best options for their yards and how to care for what they looking for even with the wholesale discount i can get from the nursery i used to work at for most basic things like hydrangeas rhododendrons and most perennials i can get just as high quality stock for cheaper at lowes
gardening,most mine have been days
gardening,thank you so much this is really helpful i m in zone it does appear to be nutrient deficiency based on what you said i will go get a fertilizer tonight i haven t fertilized yet just build this raised bed two weeks ago and put quite a bit of cow manure which i thought would be enough for a while but it doesn t seem to be the case your plants look so healthy and i love your setup you ve given me some ideas for my new raised bed
gardening,chickens and ducks are your friend
gardening,take them out of the sun right away submerge them in water for to hours if the roots have already dried out and shrunk there may be a problem but maybe not after you take them out of the water for or hours take them out of the water and let the surfaces of the pits and roots dry out for about one hour maybe check to make sure they are dry then follow my method as described in my last message note that roots don t like being exposed to sun or light
gardening,goals
gardening,i kind of doubt it i think its just a neat thing that people do to prove they can keep it alive i think the plants would have to at least be in the same family for that tomatoes are solanaceae nightshades and cannabis is cannabaceae which includes hops and hackberry i think there a hybrid out there made by grafting where the fruits sort of take on each others qualities but for a weed plant to have a similar grafting you have to use a hops vine or small hackberry tree
gardening,yum
gardening,thank you for the explanation
gardening,im gon na guess the side you gave less of as crap on just from personal experience thats how it went for me
gardening,after seedlings pop indoors and get true leaves you throw them a i mean outside near where they will be planted to get accustomed to temperatures and sun in that area then transplant eases transition
gardening,i sure your forest is teaming with hummingbirds and all their chatter i want to sit in the middle of the flowers and just enjoy the show
gardening,anti gmo sentiment it s costing lives i m curious though how do you think that someone questioning the necessity of gmos somehow leads to people dying
gardening,traditional bonsai pots are not large if you were looking to keep her as a bonsai and limit the shoots i recommend actually looking for a snake pot and going for a little more pruning on the top
gardening,thank you i will try this
gardening,this is the first time in seasons that i planted sunflowers from seed years ago i planted quite a few sunflower plants in my veggie garden they reseeded themselves season after season all i did was thin them when they sprouted
gardening,indeed it was lucrative and fun i can still smell the combination of the creek and blackberries
gardening,they are biennial leaves first year flowers second they self seed easily and some roots produce for several years
gardening,oh gotcha yeah summer storms can be devastating definitely had a bad hail storm wreck my garden poor zucchini leaves looked like someone took a shotgun to them
gardening,you are probably over watering if the soil is moist then dont touch it let the soil dry out before giving water
gardening,they do require a bit of watering you do want them to get dry and during the summer they can drink but hollyhocks actually do very well out here
gardening,oh interesting i never heard of that would the tomatoes or weed take on qualities of the other plant
gardening,juniper berries go great with fish and game meats as they are just do use them too much they pretty heavy on your kidneys
gardening,they love to layer themselves like this in my bromeliad leaves how cute
gardening,hm that an interesting idea although that might leave the bottom for critters to sneak in it also might be a pain for me to get in there but that definitely something to think through
gardening,thank you for the tip unfortunately i m only working with the space on my apartment patio so i don t have room to grow much but i m hoping by next year i ll have a better set up or maybe even a backyard
gardening,thanks
gardening,goals
gardening,oh yeah that exactly what i was looking for that makes a lot of sense its an integral its affected by both the temperature above some threshold and the time held there so in that sense average temperature does have an impact so even if you ca increase the minimum temp much simple greenhouse without insulation or heating increasing the daytime high significantly would have an affect on early growth this is based on a quick skim of the i go read further thanks a bunch
gardening,thanks i am going to look up some desserts with lavender in them
gardening,is cedar mulch costing the same as other mulch thx
gardening,now that i think of it it does sound vaguely creepy
gardening,i second this question very confused
gardening,i water it every or day i didnt think it needed any more since the soil is
gardening,it has drainage holes i put only a few inches of old soil underneath new fresh gardening mix maybe its blocking water from drianing
gardening,it is unfortunately this is the most obvious route for me here i am in norway and have not managed to get my hands on bamboo cuttings
gardening,was able to upload a pic of the other one but it behind this tree near the fence and much smaller both are dwarf varieties one is jim bacon and i forget the other one also this one has a dramatic lean to it wondering if i should worry about that i would tie it to the fence to the left but worried that will pull down the fence use some kind of anchor or does it matter
gardening,i did indeed enjoy this very much thank you
gardening,thanks that makes sense i tried searching for meteorologists in my area referencing garden or planting but no luck yet i am opening the weather forecast multiple times per day now that average last frost date is near just excited to still see no frost in sight i have a couple large plant blankets i can use in a pinch do you just worry about frost temps or even like high low do you cover up your tomatoes
gardening,they are aphids use neem oil
gardening,like wow
gardening,great plant great for the garden great for people too
gardening,caught these in the wild i would love to grow them but i gathered they can be difficult to grow
gardening,the gd squirrels steal my veggies eat one bit leave it i want to turn them into squirrel stew
gardening,i thought marigolds were the sacrificial plant that you have to draw the bugs to chew on rather than your veggies
gardening,that a relief it my first time starting seeds inside so i super paranoid i going to mess it up lol
gardening,that really helpful thanks minimum temperature seems the more difficult to influence for example a super simple greenhouse can get the daytime high temp much higher but without decent insulation or active heating probably wo do much for the nighttime low thus increasing the average but not the minimum so as with most things not an easy answer
gardening,some seed kits
gardening,little guy has got to eat too
gardening,both soil temp and air temp are important plants have a unique temperature requirements for optimal growth it generally a range between a high and low temps how fast a plant grows depends upon how much time the environment provides the optimal temperature for both the roots and shoots in agriculture this is referred to as gdu or gdd
gardening,ahhh yiss a yard full of beautiful outhouse flowers ever since i learned that hollyhock were colloquially called outhouse flowers during the times i can t help but think of them that way next year plant some dwarf hollyhock too and then you ll have multiple heights of these beauties i highly recommend the peaches and cream hybrids sooo pretty
gardening,i should done raised beds honestly
gardening,for the chrome fixture still attached
gardening,in a bed that is roughly long by ft wide i probably mixed in about large bags cubic ft of gardening soil into it along with smaller bags of manure and large bags of a woody landscape mix over the last years and the aeration of my soil is still not fantastic last year i used a tiller and this year because i did prioritize my ammending i had to mix it all in by hand and it took me hours a day in the garden for days straight to get it all mixed soil is looking much better now but still not ideal clay soil sucks
gardening,i also love the small bush on the side trimmed like a broccoli crown
gardening,could you potentially use some type of netting suspended from stakes stuck in the middle of the bed sort of like a giant circus tent that would let you adjust to whatever height you need for your plants
gardening,what has your weather been like
gardening,thanks i may have gotten carried away planting from seed this year and have a ton of plants i have the space to plant them all but i would need a whole lot of bubbles i am planting tomato plants and pepper plants i might just error on the side of caution or since i have so many plants plant some earlier and if they die i have some still
gardening,minimum temperature most seedlings are fine with a wide variety of temperatures but cold can do them in or in some cases severely slow their growth like peppers and tomatoes for example soil temperature and air temperature should both stay above that minimum and the difference between the two should be too big
gardening,what does water regularly mean
gardening,came here to say probably too much water looks a bit soggy
gardening,raised garden bed question can i use marble pieces like long marble rectangles to make a raised garden bed as the frame instead of wood i have been able to find any info about this maybe because marble is usually expensive but there a shop nearby where extra marble pieces are thrown out for free and i never made a raised bed before is there some reason why this would work
gardening,i don t know if it s low on nutrients so much as it s not totally finished it was warm when i picked it up so i think the nutrients may just not be fully available that s why i think next year will probably end up being better although it will have been on the groin over a month before put my tomatoes cucumbers and melons in
gardening,pull it out that s the only way to know for sure
gardening,i did find any posts that meet the matching requirements for it might be oc it might not things such as jpeg artifacts and cropping may impact the results i not perfect but you can help report false negative mwyzir view search on scope reddit meme filter true target check title false max age unlimited searched images search time
gardening,and if it does start to have root rot you actually need to clean the roots of any dirt already on them and put new fresh dirt and fertilizer in
gardening,do you have drainage holes the plant doesnt get rot
gardening,it s a seed starter kit so they are peet pellets that expand with water and are held together with a really fine biodegradable mesh i ve always had really good results with them
gardening,it pretty damn cool that you named it
gardening,i dig it up mix it up with compost and triple mix
gardening,love the cinder block garden
gardening,shh i taking a nap yawn
gardening,which episode
gardening,rub it in why don t ya lol
gardening,oh okay will keep that in mind thanks for all the advice i glad you are happy with your silk plant
gardening,put a camera up one time i delivered to a customer a light turned on and a recording said you are under surveillance i almost burst out laughing but i get why he would be so careful
gardening,the sculpted shrub is dope too
gardening,i live with a meanie who puts his cigarette buts different places in my garden even if he was asked not to it hard to talk to him further because he is emotionally abusive and physically aggressive i have been cleaning up after him luckily he supposed to be leaving soon so there should be any more i going to try to bioremediate those patches of soil so that even if i do live here long enough to safely plant veggies in those places at least the next tenants who might not know there were cigarette butts there wo be harmed i planting sunflowers and other flowers in those places to suck up the toxins what do i do with the stalks and foliage and everything when they die i not sure what they do with the yard waste collection do i put them in there also the meanie also smoked in our basement for months until we caught him what is a plant that grows with low light that can suck up lots of toxins ideally i would want a species that grows with both low light and low water so i do have to go down there often but i do know if that pushing it
gardening,ik kan nederland altijd herkennen aan de huizen haha mooie tuin
gardening,nothing just another thing we face after we think we in the clear was empathizing
gardening,agree to that i felt like as i screen each dahlia picture each in photoshop added the in photoshop created a google doc inserted each image changed each image properties to wrap text changed each image size to moved them around to a somewhat coherent fashion and they still look inconsistent that there just had to be a better way lol
gardening,lol maybe
gardening,don t touch his spaghet
gardening,what is hardening off
gardening,not quite
gardening,that what makes the water jackets so useful that water gets warm in the sun during the day and has a pretty substantial thermal mass to keep the plant above freezing at night if you use them you find that you can play with them to narrow the hole on the top down to nothing i keep them open normally to avoid overheating but if we going to get close to frost temps i close the tops up to keep the warm air in
gardening,hahaha it s a special little thing that s for sure
gardening,so i looked it up and asked a local gardening master and i found out that for my area vinca minor is considered invasive which is great news my tulips and daffodils should be able to with it too which is more good news i also love the creeping phlox you showed me and think it would be perfect for another area i am cultivating in the yard so thank you so much for all your helpful advice and recommendations
gardening,looks like the plant tried to divide by zero
gardening,they ll generally brown out unless you deadhead them and keep them watered if they do dry out you can cut them back and they ll come back the next year just fine
gardening,no need to trim trimming at this stage would just remove leaves that they desperately need they do look really leggy you could repot them but deeper and then give them a place with more light
gardening,really i hate this plant because it spreads where i do want it
gardening,looks like a fungus gnat the adult the fly is harmful to the plant but it larvae eat the roots so kill it
gardening,all is well and good til you look away for second and then those weeds get eaten
gardening,in the process of power washing my house what a difference it makes your home looks lovely i love good old fashioned elbow grease and sweat equity
gardening,if you throwing squirrel away you wasting some tasty meat
gardening,wassup fool
gardening,happy cake day
gardening,how in hollyhock did they get so tall
gardening,gardening and hardening
gardening,i lolled
gardening,i love a good garden cat
gardening,well you did say please
gardening,squirrels are raising young right now just something to consider this time of year i do know about other states but squirrels are in season until the end of may
gardening,i do grow veg myself but if you want a good resource for container gardening try the bountiful container by mcgee and stuckey i deals w growing vegetables herbs and edible flowers in pots i found it a good place to start i used it for the past three years trying new kitchen herbs on my balcony
gardening,thanks i had read as much but have no experience but i do have patience my only concern is that it a drought year again in cali fingers crossed
gardening,wow i thought i had a lot of them i have close to as much not blooming yet but you have a friggin fiesta of them do you get any pests something is eating up mine a bit at the bottom but not enough to stop them
gardening,wow that not good do you have other tomatoes in the vicinity what are their conditions was it doing fine and then all of a sudden got sick or was it starting to from an early stage my first reaction is that you have some nasty bacterial wilt that got going in the plant if you have others in the area that look just fine i would go with that not really anything to be done if that the case
gardening,squirrel launcher
gardening,do worry the op is either a bot or a scammer every post of his is stolen content
gardening,lol my grandfather and garden mentor told me to do this but warned that it s a never ending task
gardening,i planted seedlings last year and they barely made it a foot high and no flowers this year they already a foot high and hoping for something i believe they take a few years to really come in
gardening,how lovely just some good old fashioned whoring your unconsenting children out for fake internet points great parenting
gardening,awe this made me smile thank you
gardening,there s more but that gives you a rough idea i m not a very experienced gardener either so maybe someone else with more knowledge can help you out more last year i grew squash and cucumber and herbs from seed and harvested through fall the rest i did from seedling it s okay if you want to grow from seedling to start out with in fact it might give you a boost to see how well you gardening to begin with happy planting
gardening,squirrels are raising young this time of year and are in season though it might motivate some people just think of the nests of starving baby squirrels that lose their parents
gardening,oh shit i just planted some of these lads in a container on my balcony
gardening,thin it down to plants after it germinates
gardening,fyi jipped is usually spelled gypped and was probably coined as a racist stereotype regarding gypsies many people have stopped using it for this reason there more info on google
gardening,i m gon na be having fencing up in the next few weeks so problem will be solved i was just frustrated because last year they didn t eat them and then i learnt they are toxic so when i transplanted them because they were in a spot that s going to be excavated i moved them to the open in the sun thinking they wouldn t be touched but low and behold they were eaten
gardening,they likely jiffy pods
gardening,right they my buzz buddy
gardening,edit it s surrounded by thousands of irises not iraqis lol weird autocorrect although all are welcome haha
gardening,that so cute
gardening,it is absolutely beautiful i love snow
gardening,also edible though the texture can be a bit fuzzy has a mild cucumber taste
gardening,it s not an option that many people are presented with pays better to remove and replace
gardening,a place for the best guides pictures and discussions of all things related to plants and their care technically not a plant
gardening,and here i am in california picking salad greens every day
gardening,i know there are a couple rabbits here but i haven t seen any yet and i live on an acreage it s spring everything is growing there is surplus food for them so why they chose toxic plant beats me
gardening,shoot them and eat them i one step away from that because i feed them good shelled sunflower seeds bacon fat fresh apples pfft those mfers just want to shred my pansies right now
gardening,hello i have finally been brave enough to try gardening i still have a lot to learn and i m really confused about what s going on with my mounding mandevilla a significant number of the flowers have fallen off also some of the remaining flowers have black spots on their petals and are shriveling i am keeping them in indirect light on my west facing balcony i live in central texas i mist them every day and use a moisture meter to determine when to water i used miracle grow bloom food once a week they are still in the same planter that i bought them in it offers good drainage at least i think thank you very much
gardening,you can make amazing syrup out of magnolia flowers now is the season
gardening,i m in belchertown we got inches
gardening,i wouldn t assume that the compost you got is low on nutrients based on my knowledge of municipal compost although yes it would have been ideal to mix it in with soil and let it sit i d recommend growing beans they can still be planted from seed this time of year and they are nitrogen fixing there are lots of varieties including french beans and runner beans which can be eaten as a vegetable rather than bean and they re easy to grow
gardening,what kind of plant is this i was gifted one and it doing the same thing looks great by the way
gardening,that s why i just shoot them free fertilizer
gardening,yeah they pop with moisture if you use the paper towel method you see roots in days if you bury them a bit they take about a week to break the soil but not a big deal
gardening,worms are so innocent themselves they eat seeds and seedlings nature is neat and that a pretty looking spider too
gardening,that supposed to happen not anything you did it did do
gardening,interesting thanks what climate are you in
gardening,never knew this existed a very interesting solution i will look into a local company
gardening,this is exactly what i love about gardening taking what you have and getting the best out of it thanks for sharing this is beautiful
gardening,why does this happen
gardening,so i have seeds that i bought on etsy and claim to have an germination rate i did realize they germinate really fast i might as well plant a bunch and see what takes and then plant more thanks so much for the tips
gardening,i recently started making and using fetid swamp water as a way to fertilize some of my plants so far it working well and they seem to love it i had to find an alternative to traditional compost because in my climate it breaks down too quickly so it was disappearing before i could even use it this video explains how to make it diluted urine also works well especially for leafy greens because it a huge nitrogen boost among others stuff it free readily available and is what humanity has been using since the beginning of time
gardening,please do
gardening,that s some juicy spaghet
gardening,at least yours are sprouting mine are still covered in snow from winter
gardening,blood meal langbeinite bone meal kelp meal
gardening,i don t see how putting a border around it would do any harm as long as you re not digging it up and putting in a whole new bed you shouldn t have any problems if you out in like a raised bed it will be burdensome to access but other than that i don t see a detriment
gardening,we struggle with chipmunks and strawberries they eat them white and burrow i thinking about pulling the berries and giving them away just covering the tops would give them cover from hawks of which we have plenty
gardening,awesome thanks for this i do have compost and was planning on mixing it in but happy to skip the tilling
gardening,i in michigan zone and i just put together my first raised bed garden space trying to hopefully get some seeds in the ground over the weekend here but i finding a lot of information that revolves around starting seeds indoors which is making it challenging my issue is that i do have any way to grow seeds indoors i do have grow lights i do have any good spaces near windows for getting sunlight and i do have any of the necessary equipment like the trays to grow indoors i know a lot of people suggest to just buy the proper equipment so i can start seeds early but considering this is my first season i trying to lean a bit lighter on the expenses to just get a feel for gardening this weekend i was considering planting carrots radishes and chives but according to the growing calendar on for my area these should have been planted at least days prior for radishes so i thinking i may be too late on these not sure if i can still squeeze them in this late the following weekend i am looking to plant potatoes cilantro and onions again according to the same growing calendar it seems like these all can be direct sown in late may so i feel a little more confident in these do you guys have any other recommendations of crops that work well without needing to be transplanted to get a harvest in time
gardening,my pug will eat anything in the garden i planted blackberry bushes just for him now age does matter once they know how to forage
gardening,i really need to research these being in tx i have a similar to phoenix so these might work for me
gardening,i obsessed with the dogwoods in our neighborhood this year they even more stunning than the roses
gardening,i love hollyhocks so much i hope mine will get this big
gardening,because of the implications
gardening,yikes dude why not just shoot them better than dropping them off somewhere they slowly starve to death
gardening,i thinking you right
gardening,usually if you give them a source of water they leave your tomatoes alone for the most part you may still end up with a tomato or two with bites in it i also give them black oil sunflower seed i buy in bulk and they leave the bird feeders completely alone
gardening,i also been teaching my kid to pick dandelions in the garden the trick is getting her to pick only the dandelions
gardening,oh then that makes sense
gardening,i pulled all my strawberries out and replanted with beets damned birds eat everything above the ground
gardening,how did you amend your clay soil i m new to gardening and have just started to look into this
gardening,the green ones aren t ripe yet
gardening,so cute
gardening,mine dropped down a few weeks ago and bounced back after a few days
gardening,the deer at my mil s house are testing my ability to choose plants for her yard but she leaves food out for them in the winter so i cant do much for her she invites them over they are gon na eat everything eventually dont hate the deer hate the loss of their natural predators
gardening,thanks for the warning i be buying a small greenhouse for my grow bags this winter unfortunately i rent so grow bags are my only option at this time thank you for the recommendations
gardening,i think i would like swallows at least they are pretty
gardening,just place the entire thing less chance of disturbing the roots
gardening,we planted purple bearded iris last summer and one of them bloomed yellow like wtf messing up the whole color scheme
gardening,hah i have a trough planter on one side i have seeds i started mid march under uv light with water and a regimented process of hardening off on the other side a bunch of shit i just threw the seeds in guess which side is doing better
gardening,there is a type that love malzar spinach i think you should check that out
gardening,bark is usually not very accurate but in my experience the rest is highly accurate
gardening,i m in atx our bulbines are about the only thing that didn t make it the society garlic did well i had to cut the gauras way back but they have just done tremendously well since february and look fantastic we replaced the bulbines with blackfoot daisies which are another small native flower we have variegated gingers that are coming back and we replace a couple of bushes with crossandra but both of those require some special attention they look wonderful though
gardening,there are lots of reasons tomato plants develop yellow leaves it can be over or under watering soil too cold soil too acidic or base or various plant diseases
gardening,that what i do how much are the live plants gon na cost ya
gardening,this is certain death for these creatures they spend ages storing their nuts and establishing a home but also fuck squirrels
gardening,oooohhh it probably nettle we have a lot of that growing in the fields around our house
gardening,that s my goal
gardening,yeah i thought maybe of planting stuff between them
gardening,i support any manifestation of disobedience
gardening,so cool what do you use to make the perfect circles
gardening,interesting i look into it
gardening,these are one of my favorite flowers
gardening,just potting soil or did you use something lower nutrient like coir or vermiculite
gardening,if it is monarda i let it keep growing just for kicks but i did plant it and i do think we have that growing natively here
gardening,for garlic i believe they only need but i a rookie
gardening,you have to ease into hardening indoor seedlings to the outside it appears as sunburn and in some ways it is but its also facing additional radiation its not used to facing by a grow light uv radiation
gardening,it s either baby raspberry or stinging nettle which grow together and are hard to tell apart when then are little
gardening,i guess i should have planted mine more closely i did like gaps
gardening,i was reading about it and yes it is a lily but not so sure about the cana
gardening,no smell at all it probably just a weed
gardening,it also has no smell so i thinking it just a weed
gardening,they be fine
gardening,well those things the nice thing is the house sides may create a slightly warmer microclimate in the winter so maybe it will be more like
gardening,i would till even in clay soil but i would add tons of compost honestly i have had the best luck with scattering they seem to all end up in the same place and i have to thin out all but a couple so i add several inches of compost and place the seeds where i want them before the rain
gardening,yeah tomatoes are one of the last things to go outside they don t like below at night
gardening,thank you i hope that s just it it was a hot sunny day
gardening,your city does have birds
gardening,yuppppp and i hate deer luckily it s pretty hard to kill a hosta they still come back each year
gardening,sorry my comment was late i
gardening,i got curious and looked them up they look exactly like female sylvari from the mmo game guild wars
gardening,its easy to harden off your plants in philly because it always sunny there
gardening,i have an app called plantnet that identifies plants from the leaf flower berry and even bark never tried bark i find it to be very accurate
gardening,me too gramma had a hollyhock patch and mom showed me how to make hollyhock girls spent hours doing with them
gardening,city garden
gardening,is it a cana lily
gardening,deer love hostas
gardening,bamboo is super hard to grow from seed like many large grasses takes forever to germinate it s super cheap and easy to get cuttings just order some on etsy
gardening,thanks for your advice i m going to try it yours looks awesome you ve inspired me
gardening,if you need to plant a lot that might work but generally zinnias grow large enough you are better off planting single seeds at the proper spacing they germinate really fast and at such high rates that you should get plants to grow in whatever pattern you plant scattering could lead to crowding and as i said should only be done if you intend to have a large area covered with them
gardening,does look a little crowded but i m no pro i guess other bulbs do fine like that
gardening,thanks i love you lt
gardening,tough to swallow not sure its worth the grow
gardening,sunburn too hot and not enough water
gardening,f for your tomatoes but it looks like your rock crop is healthy and ready for picking
gardening,yeah late fall they are like locusts i can t have hostas in my front yard

gardening,don t know what kind of snail and much about snails or slugs could be wrong but thought they are leaves off things
gardening,personally no but furniture layout construction blueprints business flowcharts networking diagrams all worked out really well i imagine this would be doable but it does take an attempt or two to get used to it
gardening,takes forever to germinate sometimes radish for me is the easiest
gardening,the fact that that particular branch seems thicker than the actual top of the tree is suspicious if it was grafted you should be able to see some scarring where that branch joins the rest of the tree
gardening,see what s already growing in your yard then do nothing
gardening,alliteration aside it looks like lichen
gardening,sedum is like propagating cactus cutting just tossed in a pot will grow
gardening,happy cake day
gardening,i sure that not mint but i could be wrong

gardening,that awesome
gardening,the first pic looks def like sunburn
gardening,but between the snakes and the cat your house must have been bug free
gardening,uh what does hail have to do with last frost i almost exclusively see hail in the summer
gardening,they can though i see it more as google images for creeping phlox or creeping thyme it s pretty magical when they do spill out to hills and edges
gardening,we live in south florida and this time of year when it gets hotter and hotter our regular grass dies but the center of the lawn that is over our septic tank thrives we get a lot of wildflowers that sprout up right there and i was just walking by today and saw the vast amount of bees butterflies dragonflies etc that love our lawn however the rest of the lawn looks like shit and needs to be mowed i was thinking of just surrounding the area that is green over the septic tank and just letting this spot grow wild well kind of i want to put some decorative stones around it and will edge it and make sure that it does get too wild but i want to let it be a nice place for the insects to enjoy while still being able to mow the rest of the yard my husband says that if i just surround it with rocks i will somehow cut it off from and i would need to raise the soil bed in order to make it look nice what is your suggestion gardeners of reddit
gardening,my goodness what do you put in your soil
gardening,i not i was being sarcastic i think they look great lol
gardening,so magical please post another when your peony field is in bloom
gardening,this just happened to me too i got some cuttings from my aunts place but they did root and rotted so i discarded them all in my leaf compost lo and behold come spring there is an abundance of sprouts like this sticking out of the leaf pile they dont even need soil
gardening,this would not be a problem for me
gardening,what do you mean the only benefit i can think of dozens of the top of my head not having to deal with snow no salt burn on my lawn multiple harvests per year time spent outdoors increases lower heating costs avoiding sad on and on
gardening,spinach is a safe bet i actually tried to grow it in the heat of summer and that did not go well haha it likes cold temps
gardening,easthamton checking in do see too many local posts on here
gardening,i thought snails ate greenery on plants
gardening,yes he did haha i believe he is a variety of sedum definitely going to try this again and see if i can propagate more
gardening,wooah
gardening,i am referring to dish soap i ve never used hand soap before and not sure if it works but i ve had varying degrees of success with dish soap
gardening,well that fun have you used it for gardening stuff before thank you for sharing
gardening,stale beer in bowls slugs die happy
gardening,when you say washing up liquid do you mean hand soap
gardening,this is the cutest thing i seen in a long time
gardening,i sitting here trying to protect my veggies and flowers in the woods and battling the local chipmunks now you telling me i have to worry about orange tailed squirrels too where will it end
gardening,it may take a few years of experimenting to find what they like in your yard my first couple years swallows got the box but then i put it up in february and bluebirds were there in early march weeks and weeks before i expected them and they kept the sparrows out i have read about putting a second box up feet from the first if the sparrows do claim the box so it definitely recommended at times definitely not too late for this season though see what happens and enjoy that a beautiful yard you have
gardening,not sure what zone you in but i in and most of my peppers that i started on have sets of true leaves and are starting on their third you may not really be behind at all just be careful with the fertilizer on such young plants just do a dose if you using a liquid kind and only do that if the soil they growing in does already have some sort of fertilizer in it too much of a good thing will burn their roots and leaves
gardening,dogwood
gardening,i agree borage
gardening,have a plant that is years old still depressed
gardening,my kids are teens now too and after growing up weeding and planting pruning and harvesting with me they seemed to likewise dislike it later when they moved into middle school age but there hope my oldest moved out at and immediately filed her small balcony with a flourishing container garden of edibles that her neighbors envy intesely she stared a small community garden at her complex my year old will walk in the garden and bend down to weed without thinking working out her issues with the pruning shears when she needs therapy my year old will pick roses and loves starting seeds in tiny pots to plant later they all accept watering and weeding chores as part if life like laundry or washing dishes it makes me happy to see the growing bug is there even if it goes dormant for awhile
gardening,just plant a bunch of them i got about of to sprout and it took like weeks so i started losing hope but they eventually popped up also i just planted them in dirt to start
gardening,dude i deeply appreciate your fortress presently enjoying hollyhock sproutlets mself
gardening,thank you i try it
gardening,i put deer corn in the backyard to keep em out of the front yard i plant the annuals and perennials in the front it works
gardening,a mix of washing up liquid and water to wash down the plant gently as well as squashing large colonies with your finger are probably the best bet that is without buying purpose made spray to kill the aphids of course
gardening,i agree someone dropped the ball for sure pretty much all of the greenhouses in my area expanded operations after last years epic sales
gardening,is hardware cloth the same or similar to wire remesh
gardening,cute
gardening,sedum he adhered to your request
gardening,i use the strawberrys to bait and trap those critters
gardening,yes collect some ladybugs
gardening,the leaves of my milkweed seedlings have been turning red and withering away i discovered these insects on the underside of the leaves which i believe are responsible for this condition i was thinking of getting rid of them with soapy water is that a good idea or is there something else i should do
gardening,oh my these are awesome plants so pretty
gardening,pretty cool but just know you need to graft on a cutting of a different avocado tree if you want good ones they do grow true to seed
gardening,looks like borage to me
gardening,looks a little crowded to me but i would be worrying if i was in your shoes
gardening,i wo it fun
gardening,why not do wisteria or a pretty vine like a suckle
gardening,snow is so
gardening,great job nothing like some hard work and lovely weather
gardening,you got ta practice having hands somehow
gardening,is this supposed to be a or are you asking anyway my fav top low maintenance are tomatoea bell peppers hot peppers lettuce snap peas onions from sets green beens zuccini pumpkins sweet corn
gardening,lettuce i ca grow and i am getting tonnes
gardening,cute it looks like a dream
gardening,that looks so magical
gardening,zone not so bad i know and i almost exclusively grow peppers i do know why i do this to myself i had to unfollow hotpeppers
gardening,that s hilarious
gardening,the bricks are a nice touch we got an outdoor cat strawberries and cherry tomatoes saved
gardening,very soothing
gardening,shredded is softer no screening needed
gardening,thistles and dandelions are easy peasy
gardening,jokes on you i live in south florida garden zone gang
gardening,okay squidy
gardening,there never a need to kill a snake friendly venomous or not just leave them be they work wonders for pest control and play a vital role in the ecosystem snakes can be defensive especially small ones because they are common prey items but they are aggressive
gardening,everyone talking about how hard it was to register at their lowe i just showed up to mine randomly and some lady gave me a handful of these little guys
gardening,that is absolutely amazing
gardening,thats all i want in life preferably against the fence so my backyard is private
gardening,my asclepias tuberosa seeds were started in my season room with good light but no heat a little slow to emerge but they showed up
gardening,when you so near the bottom of the food chain you tend to be a little feisty
gardening,mine were loblolly pines i not sure if they gave out the same tree across the country or differed from region to region
gardening,first time using jiffy peat pellets for starting seeds i ready to transplant them they have set of true leaves and i know i have to remove the netting should i be up the peat pellet as well prior to transplanting or just place the entire pellet in the pot and surround it with new soil
gardening,if their roots and the stems are intact they should be fine seedling can regrow leaves but not if the stems were crushed as the water and nutrient flow will be obstructed
gardening,bwaahaahaa
gardening,lol less of a recipe and more of a craft project set water to boil brown ground beef in a separate pan caramelize onions and then add fresh mushrooms and finely cut basil and thyme at the last minute and combine in one pan add roma marinara sauce let it simmer add rana freah italian sausage ravioli then fresh cheese tortellini to boil add pasta to sauce for final minute of cooking voila
gardening,this is good information to know thank you
gardening,my fall decorative pumpkins not grown just bought from the grocery store to make the porch look pretty have been a target for smashing before something about large vegetables makes some people wan na smash them
gardening,you could pull and try to transplant when i plant multiple seeds in one container it because i assume not all seeds will germinate if and when i do get multiple sprouts from one pot i typically snip the weakest seedling out and let the other continue growing if you plan on only feeding family plants will be enough if you are planning on canning however if you want to keep all of them i advise trandplanting them to bigger containers soon and you also run the possibility of damaging the roots of good plants when you go to separate them
gardening,great
gardening,these are gorgeous
gardening,i probably an ocean away thanks for the offer tho
gardening,thanks for the advice i will check it out
gardening,i m just interested it s an unusual hobby if you aren t working for a company in the industry i been debating idiots for a long time it important that misinformation is allowed to spread but the truthers are whittled down to the true idiots right now the chemtrailers are similarly reduced and keep spinning too many new arguments to make it worthwhile the faction are still strong still using the same idiotic theories and are actually causing harm if you think that bush did it not going to impact the world very much anti gmo sentiment it costing lives
gardening,plants are
gardening,have learned there is no such think as deer only will eat only if nothing else is maybe it was rabbits
gardening,nope totally free i also use seek but plantnet seems a little better with plants overall
gardening,haha i love em both i am having severe mws
gardening,the squirrels in my neighborhood are relentless
gardening,we are starting to rotate them outside to harden off thank you for the walls of water suggestion i will look into that and i think our local nurseries carry that product i imagine that water will be a better insulator than plastic sheeting for keeping the tomatoes warm during the night
gardening,make a beautiful houseplant
gardening,i just wrote this on another thread but i think it applies to your situation too i planted moringa seeds right before a week of chilly weather then read that moringa are difficult to germinate and probably wo if it less than i do have heating mats or any equipment since i just start everything outside year round and i have no access to of my fridge i had the moringa seeds planted in a large oz yogurt container i put a ziplock baggie on top of it to keep in moisture and stuck the the whole thing in the oven with the light on i put a temp gauge in there and discovered that the lightbulb inside my oven keeps it at degrees within day the first seed sprouted and the seed sprouted the following day maybe you could give this a try
gardening,wow what a beauty
gardening,bought plants at the garden center years ago and they just thrived i bad at starting from seed
gardening,it ok because the seeds are power bottoms
gardening,i m just interested it s an unusual hobby if you aren t working for a company in the industry prior to this moment i had never thought about if herbicides are pesticides or not a quick look at a definition suggests to me that a pesticide is defined as something to control any pest and a herbicide is defined as something that controls unwanted plants so it would seem a herbicide has to be a type of pesticide but that s only if those definitions are correct and i don t care to look into it further
gardening,so many wmass people on this thread always super cool to see a post from a town right next to mine
gardening,i honestly had no idea there were so many of us this brings me great joy
gardening,second this consistently hitting the low at night is not ideal but it also not a death sentence the plants will grow slowly and may show a little cold stress however as long as most days reach the the plants are much more at risk of permanent stunting from being potbound and than from going outside my parents always used walls of water in their chilly wny garden and they worked great at bumping temps up a few precious degrees maybe you could diy something similar out of plastic water bottles
gardening,do you have to pay for that one i tried a plant identification app before not for this plant though and it did work very well and also required a monthly fee after the free trial so i canceled it haha
gardening,yeah the lesson is really just that we started seeds too early for tomatoes thanks for the input
gardening,fight milk stronger plants less powdery mildew
gardening,i did smell it haha i was just walking by with my dogs and took a pic because i thought it would be perfect for covering up the cement retaining wall in my front yard haha
gardening,i feel like my best strategy at this point will be ordering some live plants hoping they survive the shipping russian roulette and then seed saving a few generations worth of them
gardening,did you grow these from seed or plant them as plants just curious trying to get something similar going in one of my beds yours looks lovely
gardening,i agree
gardening,put a pizza and baby in there and i think you got a picture of all the good stuff seriously though very nice indeed
gardening,oof i fail again lol what it smell like
gardening,not the subreddit i expected to find such photos in but i always a fan of a great flush very nice
gardening,woah gorgeous wish i had them
gardening,cucumber is fun to container grow and trellis
gardening,it i know all my friends will have a bumper crop of chillies this year while literally less than half of my seeds have even germinated
gardening,love these grape hyacinth always remind me of my childhood and my moms garden
gardening,i do not think it is wisteria haha
gardening,that face
gardening,thanks for the advice it definitely looks suffocating for other plants i was hoping to do this in my front yard since i live in an old house on a hill with a very retaining cement wall that would be nice to cover a bit haha do the other plants you suggested also have the effect
gardening,good luck
gardening,why do you care but tell me do you think that herbicides are pesticides
gardening,they look great amazing job mate
gardening,i m in chicago so we didn t get hit with that late but we did have way more snow than usual
gardening,it ll be fine might need some help securing them to the trellis when they get a little bigger then they should be good
gardening,it looks delicious
gardening,i threw down some seed a few months ago now i excited
gardening,it exists let me know if you find seeds though
gardening,kinda sounds like the problem sorted itself out
gardening,get some radish seeds if you want to try your hand at veggies they just as easy and fast to grow from seed
gardening,im i never plant out tomatoes until almost the end of may no point as it doesn t get hot enough for them to grow until that time anyways
gardening,lovely collection
gardening,so cute lt
gardening,yes but then degrees weather most year round
gardening,they need a while to soak i would do flat per day if i was working with fill the tray half way with the plants in it in the am remove at night
gardening,well the majority of sources say that they probably are viable and wo germinate you could still try and see if they grow if you put them in a plastic bag and some damp paper towel wait the expected amount of time for germination and if none of them sprout then they probably wo you might want to get new seeds from a different seller or contact the company that sold them to you for a refund probably both
gardening,pour boiling water on em
gardening,you may enjoy reading this
gardening,that s a good one i ll add what do your kiddos like to pick to that as well i had great success with a sugar snap pea in a hanging pot last year and my little one loved picking them fresh for a side dish every night so all around win
gardening,that what someone else outside of reddit said it hard to say but it is a fairly young tree
gardening,hollyhocks are great the bees just love them
gardening,yabut they look vaguely like avocados or artichokes so my incredibly opinion may just trump your scientific knowledge
gardening,we got a bunch of volunteer hollyhocks over the last few years that have been repopulating everywhere i love em
gardening,excellent thank you i am familiar with superthrive and it is good stuff i leave it be for now thanks again
gardening,sunflowers are a definite exception
gardening,ohhh ok i see the containers sitting there
gardening,we had a degree day and snow the next day
gardening,wisteria maybe yeah idk could be pretty sure maybe let go with that
gardening,this winter was a bit of an anomaly it is usually no where near that cold
gardening,i kept my veggies in pots and moved them in and out still looking for a warm stretch to plant them outside of philly
gardening,what do you like eating i d say start there size of mature plant determines size of container typically
gardening,bottom watering seedlings how deep should the water be in the tray and how long do you leave them in there i have flats under grow lights and can use an extra tray for the water tray in another part of the basement but it seems to be kinda slow to feel them gaining water they are super light when dry i guess i am trying to figure out if i should leave them long enough to make coffee or to drink it in the morning vs min
gardening,hahahaha
gardening,that s when you need to upgrade from fake to real
gardening,keep in mind if your planting is next to a building still has a good amount of afternoon sun the cold will not settle like it would out in the open thus increasing it cold tolerance by you can also spray with an anti dessicant like wilt pruf to protect the canes i would prune back the dead wood until early to mid summer in early spring in northern climates you would prune back more than needed seeing the tree appears more dormant even in late spring threadleaf japanese maples take a while give it super thrive this spring rooting hormone and keep it watered years from now it be fine
gardening,yum will look forward to the after pic
gardening,i battle with the squirrels over the bird feeder and my tomatoes in my garden so i trap them and drive them out about miles away and release them in the woods some years i will trap up to sixty squirrels so i started to spray the tails with a shot of orange marker paint and never saw one return
gardening,no worries
gardening,yikes mercury in a well sounds like a good way to ingest poisonous heavy metals
gardening,i in and read my notes from last year we had hail june long after every last frost date for this zone that i seen lol
gardening,it available for purchase
gardening,unfortunately this area is infested with japanese knotweed and there s no killing that horrible shit so all my plants will be in containers not straight in the soil
gardening,it s gon na have potted veggies mostly peppers but also tomatoes cucumbers and zucchini
gardening,the other reason to water when the sun is not blazing away is that water droplets sitting on some plants fuzzy and furry ones can act like a magnifier and cause sunburn i know it something that can happen with tomato plants so that is another consideration
gardening,you are welcome
gardening,it looks like periwinkle or vinca minor which is very invasive and would suffocate your other plants great alternative would be creeping or moss phlox which would give you pink blue or purple ground cover very fragrant too
gardening,mulch works wonders
gardening,if is a regular thing for you that tree will die annually
gardening,i like to fertilize mine with a little bit of fight milk too
gardening,pine cones and all true cones are produced by a group of plants called gymnosperms since gymnosperms do not flower they do not form a fruit as an ovary for their seed so technically not a fruit
gardening,i suggest patience give them some time and see how they fare in a week or so
gardening,when i showed my mom all the wild violets blooming in my yard she immediately sent me a recipe for candied violets
gardening,good tips thanks
gardening,that makes sense i think it has to be a drainage issue rather than filling to much to great a bogging issue it has only been filled or the soil watered directly for a couple of years because i could get it to dry out i did want to add more to the reservoir i hope that makes sense
gardening,does mexican oregano even exist or is it a shared hallucination been trying to grow this for like a year and i never managed to find so much as a single live plant for sale locally or a single seed for sale on the internet
gardening,nah i was ecpecting a shitty bare root apple seedling not good but not completly different than advertised also the first free pickup from lowe was awesome
gardening,oh sunflowers grow very fast
gardening,i give you mine if you are in the area
gardening,which is so surprising because the huge surge in gardening intrest has been on the news everywhere someone did do their research
gardening,use the plantnet app it works well for this sort of thing
gardening,baths are great i have already as palnters and they free
gardening,this is outdated information while i certainly understand not wanting to use anything that has the way that wood is treated was changed around and does not include arsenic which was the main driver behind being unsafe to each his own but saying treated lumber is not safe for foods you consume is scientifically decently sourced article here
gardening,they dead jim you might be able to prune them back and get some new growth but it would likely be slow and forever stunted you are probably better off replanting this spring has been hard on a lot of gardeners
gardening,omg lowes is the worst
gardening,the one with the purple flowers looks like creeping phlox but i not positive
gardening,i like the satisfaction of seeing the whole process of an easy plant like sunflowers water leaves then bam tall
gardening,genuine question do you work for a company involved in production of herbicides it s fascinating seeing your account is mainly arguing over these things dozens of comments a day seemingly for months and months or is it just a hobby
gardening,gardener here we got last weekend and flurries yesterday i usually wait until may for tomatoes i ve lost too many to late frosts
gardening,oh one other thing i always put a layer of mulch on top of the soil like it so cheap and makes it look nice but it also helps keep the soil temperature more even and keeps the soil more evenly moist i like to think it has helped i guess i should have reapplied some in the fall over my daffodil patch though cause the smallest ones definitely popped up during our warm spell in february and then died sigh
gardening,i had this moment but it was flower blossoms when the wind picked up i was baffled for a minute before i realized it was snow in april
gardening,yikes that pretty wild ok my totally suggestion would be pop the pot off my guess is the soil ball will be a compacted mass of root take a big knife and slice the soil ball into half or quarters like a pie repot the or chunks in larger pots wait a week a good number of the plants will probably die at this point trim out such that you have one plant left in each pot i ca guarantee that any of them would survive this procedure since i have no idea how tangled up the roots all are if you just want a guaranteed something and do want as much risk then just right now cut all the stems except off at the soil and replant into a larger pot
gardening,i love the contrast of colors so much
gardening,some self watering units aren t designed with proper watering amount and frequency in mind this unit relies on capillary wicking and will not adjust or provide a metered amount according to plant need but will instead allow water to bog the soil as long as the soil has an ounce of open space to wick water into you can still use it but i d give ample break before filling the supply reservoir according to plant water needs or plant bog loving plants
gardening,i may experiment with a few different mediums thanks
gardening,so beautiful tho
gardening,that makes thank you
gardening,ooh reminds me of cherry blossom season in animal crossing so pretty
gardening,omgggg sunflowers i m sorry i shoulda read this first hahaha mine are not sunflowers though guess i ll have to wait for them to bloom then search online for them they get red and yellow tube like flowers sorry about all of this hahaha maybe i need a nap or something lol
gardening,thanks i gon na move every other one out of there today i have another good place for them
gardening,full of promise what are your plans for the area
gardening,i did the same thing planting two or three to a pot i just separated them the other day and they are tough little dudes because they stood up good and all are fine
gardening,personally i d lay cardboard down first it will help kill weeds and grass underneath
gardening,gorgeous spring bloomers refresh my garden soul so much
gardening,i will line a lof my planters with weed cloth it helps to keep the soil in the planter and not escaping through the drains holes or pluging smaller holes up i will also put a layer of gravel at the bottom to help the soil from sitting in water thats not draining it works pretty good but on bigger planters i will mulch other wise the dirt dries to fast on hot days
gardening,i don t think you have to worry about the exact temp just do the ol finger soil check or a wooden stick if you don t wan na get dirty to check and see how moist the soil is and adjust accordingly
gardening,sunflowers
gardening,what are these i planted some seeds and they came up looking just like this only problem was i forgot to write down what they were and i have a gazillion other seeds
gardening,that s awesome never seen a fasciated pineapple
gardening,hydrangea help anyone know if certain critters like to eat certain types of hydrangeas and not others a critter keeps eating all the new growth on ours planted last spring but not our neighbors any critter that can access ours can access our neighbors too so it s not an accessibility issue zone help
gardening,worth a shot
gardening,your home depot may have different price and wood types available depending on the area you can also go to a local wood shop and ask for scraps or the rejects some wood you may have to clamp straight
gardening,you got a strawberry they gave me lettuce
gardening,absolutely gorgeous
gardening,ah poomp
gardening,literally just ask for the cheapest wood it s brittle and sold in boards
gardening,spoken like a true root man
gardening,make the decision earlier than you think consider the parasitic wasps and lacewings too the wasps are so cool i don t buy the larvae for ladybirds because they re much more expensive but i think you re wasting your money unless you are treating an enclosed space
gardening,i feel like morning glories will survive anything
gardening,this is super adorable and brilliant gon na try this over the weekend with my toddler thank you
gardening,they are also good for finding morel mushrooms on the forest floor
gardening,air spading would probably be worth looking into similar to the earlier mentioned root pruning but a lot more efficient at helping older established trees
gardening,wow
gardening,you have to enter through the trash bins though
gardening,thanks pumpkins are the only plant i try and grow every year one year i had so many i was giving them away to people on the street my wifes class gets the mini pumpkins i grow sadly my seeds got ruined over winter so i need to buy them this season
gardening,they dead sorry
gardening,whoa cool i think i buy some adults when my plants are inevitably overrun by aphids soon
gardening,i have no experience with any particular variety but i can tell you a bit about this type of nut tree because they grow wild all over the pnw trees are understory trees really a big multi trunked shrub that will grow in thick shade but will be healthier and more productive in part sun if you only have one you wo be eating nuts because squirrels will not leave them alone they strip the green nuts they pilfer every last ripe nut if you want nuts you need enough trees to share
gardening,sunflowers are so rewarding to grow from seed so quick to sprout and grow
gardening,i going to shitty water color this it beautiful
gardening,i set up an led room this year and it got overrun by aphids i decided on adult ladybirds as a pest control due to price compared to other possibilities they immediately got to having loads of sex and laid squillions of eggs those eggs hatched into squillions of larvae that hoovered up everything and now they re pupating
gardening,good luck on the giant pumpkins that a bucket list plant for me too especially now that i live somewhere that gets trick or treaters
gardening,awesome good to know i do have any babies or diapers but i do have a couple of mats with them in lol i might cut them up and put a couple pieces in each of my fabric bags thanks
gardening,thanks it was shocking i thought it was a spider nest i am terrified of spiders so i almost got rid of it until i googled it now i just waiting
gardening,they look pretty frost bitten unfortunately try trimming it back to the center maybe the roots survived
gardening,thank you very much we just looking up the correct way to sheet mulching thank you for your help
gardening,noun pesticide plural noun pesticides a substance used for destroying insects or other organisms harmful to cultivated plants or to animals weeds are organisms not that hard for the rest of us correct it not that hard to understand that weeds are organisms
gardening,whoa really cool did they come to your plant or did you purchase or do something to lure them i love to have this in my garden d
gardening,research chlorosis you could possibly be a little too attentive to the shrub creating issues for it
gardening,i used to keep my pumpkins in the back i wanted another bed and room for more containers so pumpkins get moved out front i figured i grow the big ones in the hopes they wo get stolen that and i do want to move pound pumpkins
gardening,welcome to the wonderful world of gardening i teach kiddos in the garden and love the joy that putting seeds in the ground with them even after doing it times i still just as excited as they are when the seeds come up it the easiest magic there is i hope your sunflowers thrive
gardening,i have deck rail planters that have a similar concept but the drainage holes constantly plug up thankfully those are small enough to empty and refill each year and not an issue since i fill with annuals i think i have to totally empty this one to check the drainage thanks
gardening,i counted eight on this plant
gardening,it came in a surprise pack got a few of them x
gardening,thank you for your reply and i sure you right with the not needing to uproot the grass but the grass area is far lower than the path and the greenhouse at the back so we were going to put top soil down to make it all level and either put turf or seed down
gardening,i had no idea this was a thing down the internet rabbit hole i go
gardening,i think i may have to do that any drainage no matter how minimal clearly is working as it should
gardening,i know the feeling we ran out of space in the back so all i could do was try to fit some watermelons in the front yard beds between the squirrels and mischievous neighborhood kids i figured if they grew they get taken or damaged they did but that probably because they did have time to get very big typical bad planning buy all the seeds try to figure out the rest later
gardening,overall that plant looks great and is on track to give you some great results the purple bumpy leaf shows that the plant had some kind of stress it did like earlier but the perfect new growth indicates that things have been completely good for a while if i had to guess it probably edema and the plant was significantly overwatered at some point those lower leaves are going to get pruned anyway when it goes in the garden final container so no big deal
gardening,a tube at the top that adds water to a tray in the bottom of the planter there are wicking straps at the bottom of the planter which feed the water up to the soil
gardening,oh yes of course
gardening,thank you that s my goal too haha happy gardening
gardening,that s so awesome they re beautiful efficient lol
gardening,love it super cute
gardening,so lovely that shade of purple is divine
gardening,nice what potting mix you used
gardening,i am on the board of our condo assn the previous board did maintain the landscaping whatsoever here is a picture of one of the planters and the trees this is one of the smaller ones we have six planters in total the other ones are about longer all of them have trees in the middle
gardening,of course it is this is totally hard look you want to get hard do you i want to get hard i want to get very very hard i fully support the recent union between sunny
gardening,generally i do think you need to totally start the grass over think about it this way any grass that survived this long is probably tough and deep rooted for the weeds you want a selective weed control that lets you seed in to weeks quinclorac df would work well for established crab grass and you can seed in a week
gardening,i no expert but i read that you can push a spade down a couple feet away from the trunk in directions to clip old roots and it stimulate new growth i never done it but maybe something you can look into
gardening,well too close was my first thought too i put up several feet apart and even then pair has tried to take both boxes though i have a feeling i know which one they eventually settle on next year i plan on moving the second even further away in my experience the tree sparrows only get the boxes if you put them up too late earlier is better for getting the bluebirds but think about trying just one box they also probably have built nests yet even if they are planning on it here upstate ny they claim the box in march but do build a nest until may
gardening,check on both accounts seeds are from baker creek so no surprise there
gardening,i have like of them sort of by accident actually
gardening,amazon lol it the only place i know of
gardening,watering question i know in the hot summer months it important to water earlier in the morning or later in the eve to minimize water evaporation i am curious at what temperature this starts to be an issue for example last week here in seattle it was warmer than usual should i start caring about water evaporating and not water when it hotter
gardening,lowes put out a press release a few weeks ago discussing the unexpected massive response to this program essentially they were not prepared for the response they received
gardening,i ve just sowed them today so looking for a good spot to keep them i m measuring the soil temp to make you for the tip on acclimating them
gardening,old enough to know nothing is for free
gardening,where do you get this stuff my locally lowe s available powder has only a active ingredient gim me the big guns
gardening,it almost looks like there s frost settled on it never seen a tulip like this before
gardening,i guess you could argue that pinecones are fruit
gardening,wow i been to deerfield super cute town
gardening,why so
gardening,as long as it does go below say or even for too long everything is fine peonies laugh at snow the magnolias are touch and go every year they often get frostbit degrees will do it i think and turn brown
gardening,good god pot shopping annoys me but yes i think you right
gardening,could try digging it up or just keep mowing it back sheet mulching might work
gardening,looks wow
gardening,alternatives you can also take the plants outside every day to get about hours of sun after you harden them off gradually if you have already and keep them going that way i done this and while it will stress the plants some they can survive this way it also a pain moving them out and in every day walls of water are an alternative also unfortunately they fairly expensive so it probably depends upon how many plants you have and your budget these act like little greenhouses and the water will keep the internals from freezing down to about degrees i use these and would have had my first round of tomatoes out under these already except for inches of snow and cold temps all week long what you proposing will be fine as long as it does dip below freezing the toms may show some stress from low overnight temps slow growth possibly leaf purpling but it will be better than not having your plants getting properly lit if you wrap tomato cages and it does get below freezing you can cover the open tops and get a few degrees of protection
gardening,i got excited by a couple of degree days and decided to put my seedlings outside forgot them nights ago and they froze woes
gardening,the overall success rate that rooting hormone gives you is pretty slight but there are tons of plants in the world and those that are naturally harder to root will benefit more for roses though i suggest using it roses root pretty darn well actually but the moist conditions needed to root them also favors fungus roses have kind of more fungal problems than other plants so you are racing to get enough roots so you can move them to drier conditions before the fungus does them in so any little thing like root hormone can help in that case
gardening,they gorgeous
gardening,the scent for violets comes from the leaves not the flowers the leaves are distilled the oil collected is used for candles perfumes body sprays i love the scent of violets
gardening,in case anyone was wondering ny appears to be about a month behind sc
gardening,super happy to see most of them pulled through it sunny and in the today no snow in sight thanks for the pep talk
gardening,looks like a sitting room window to me
gardening,i would agree with this assessment pot too small
gardening,yeah i have a bulldog who does her best but she s not fast and a bit lazy for the job
gardening,sure is phoenix area with the area code in the trash bins now i want a hollyhock jungle do hollyhocks require a lot of water to maintain in a desert environment
gardening,it called hardware cloth but it welded wire mesh
gardening,its inch chicken wire and it was a bit of a slapdash effort so it could be easier to move and adjust i plan to frame them out with some wood or pvc to make them more manageable
gardening,interesting i ve never heard of this i ll have to do more research thanks
gardening,these are our second cherry and japanese maple trees in the same location both are now over years old the first ones lasted just about years too many of my neighbors have these plants that are larger and even older but they look really good hoping i can save them because they are very sentimental to me
gardening,i haven t heard of this do the rocks act as decoy berries i tried fake snakes and plastic owls on the fence but i ve seen them run right over the snakes and jump the owls so they dont seem to work
gardening,is it bad for these new shoots and early blooms to go through a freeze pretty though just wondering if behind the scenes it s actually not great from a foliage health perspective
gardening,absolutely
gardening,i lime to repeat that lesson every year just to prove its still true plant early and the plants get stunted then they struggle for longer to catch up eventually it will be fine but you will probably wish you had waited just a tad longer your plan sounds good though thats what i would do of course i haven t learned the lesson this year yet
gardening,can t help here but looking for tips for having a healthy maple that long just planted my japanese maple last year thankfully survived the winter here in kansas
gardening,you def don t need to smoke weed
gardening,hello all i recently moved into my house but the garden was a sorry state the lawn was mostly bald or weeds and one of the borders is overgrown with brambles and plants we do wish to keep we are turning up the grass and will be laying more soil down when it all up but the overgrown border on the left of picture in front of the small fence we are stumped on can anyone recommend something that will kill it all off but not destroy the soil the weed killers i looked at works good for dandelions and such but when strengthened to tackle that it would ruin the soil for use we cut it all back but we ca seem to get rid of it all thank you in advance for your suggestions
gardening,wo necessarily damage them but they tend to sulk and not grow get you some wall o waters they are plasric sleeves that you fill with water and they warm up the soil and keep a little bubble of warm air for your toms you put them out before you plant the package says weeks before you plant but a couple of sunny days is fine and then plant at last frost date
gardening,are you a root man or a fruit man
gardening,this makes me so happy i m nee to gardening and did all grow bags i hope i have this success
gardening,not bad here for today noticed my individualistic indoor chili decided to flower
gardening,thx thats new
gardening,omg beautiful how mine grow until they look like little weeds then wilt lol
gardening,this is what we having to do with all our plants because of our puppy ca wait for that phase to be done but at least he keeps the squirrels away
gardening,i love hollyhocks my grandmother used to have them she would make us dolls or princess out of them which we loved google or pinterest hollyhock dolls if you re interested
gardening,do you live in siberia
gardening,now that you mention it that s so true i heard that about years ago when my son was a baby not to leave plastic water bottles in the car or heat because the plastic leaches into the water but yet the gardner i follow on youtube because i m a newbie used them also for his seedlings now i m confused
gardening,i be more than happy to get a free pine seedling
gardening,fellow zone i hear you my apple is flowering at least and my indoor chinotto everything else is barely starting
gardening,here are some more pictures of both pictures of cherry tree and japanese maple
gardening,the face of someone who expects things to be free and good
gardening,the garden soil is a bag at hime depot lowe s i bought a few raised bed bags for my beds and grow bags but plan on filling them at least halfway with some of the garden soil or i couldn t afford this hobby lol
gardening,there two ways i use wildflower mixes like that to add to the existing plant population and mix it up a bit this is for more or less untended areas with a layer of fresh top soil so you more or less know that anything sprouting is from your seed mix
gardening,can you please share what we should be asking for
gardening,a little color in your salads is good enjoy
gardening,if it was treated it wouldn t be cheep and better for the environment
gardening,has anybody had good luck with rooting hormone of course
gardening,i ate some xd the taste is actually pretty nice not particularly strong as you said but i might make a salad with these occasionally just for the novelty of it
gardening,likely since the tree is planted improperly and weakened
gardening,it s actually used in different parts of the world russia thailand us that i ve seen so far to recycle and save on money
gardening,seeds feel like a boring chore planting is usually much more fun for me especially for ornamentals where placement makes a bigger difference
gardening,their mothers clearly never taught them to clean their plates
gardening,haha
gardening,what i might do is figure out times in the summer where you do have fruit for a few weeks and try to pick something that you think you would enjoy that harvests during that time perhaps something between your methley and elberta
gardening,oh yes they ll put out heh for years after that they ll still have foliage but may not produce as prolifically also they ll put out little runners baby plants once those have roots separate them from the mother plant by snipping the cord and then potting them up too free plants for the most part i would say they ll be fine over winter with the caveat that since yours are in a container you d want to bring them inside when the temps are below freezing when they re planted in the ground they re much more resilient when we had the deep freeze in texas back in feb my plants were exposed for days when it wasn t higher than degrees at any time and they were just fine
gardening,i used sunny d bottles to save space but milk jugs work best to give the plant more room
gardening,whoo hoo a product
gardening,looks like the phoenix area to me also the area code on the bins checks out
gardening,hmmm
gardening,do you have proof of this it s only for the beginning of the plants life not to mention you are already consuming all the plastic you are talking about in your food and drinks
gardening,punches op in the
gardening,thanks for the advice yeah i excited to share the experience with her obviously its more time to have her help out but the time enjoying the outside with her is priceless she actually started out by picking leaves off my shrubs and i redirected her she enjoys picking at things and handing them to me when inside its the dog hair
gardening,i think people use them for decoration for sweets dip them in a sugar glaze and put on a cake but there are other things you can do with them the flowed doesn t have much of a taste but the greens might be edible too there is also a little science experiment you can do with them since they are ph sensitive
gardening,i started them from seed about weeks ago and potted up about one week ago i think generally they looking pretty healthy but a few of them have a weird leaf or two i inspected them very carefully and ca find any sort of insect on them i think i doing a decent job of watering them enough but not too often the seed starting mix they in feeds them for up to months and i just put them in fresh mix when i potted up last week they under grow lights approx hours a day
gardening,phoenix i had no idea they did so well here until i took a different side street than normal and a house had a straight up hollyhock jungle what do they look like in summer
gardening,you have to ask the employees or just look around and know what you are looking at
gardening,darn okay my fault completely all the other plants are fine
gardening,do be surprised if it does make it
gardening,un even ground and there could be pesticides or other chemicals i don t want in my food better for your back
gardening,love living in new england
gardening,oh my that is crazy
gardening,here on long island it s the same freezing in the early morning sunny and warm mid morning so i take everything out of my closed in porch to get some real sun and by it s grey cold and windy again every day mother s day really is the turning point in ny your right
gardening,where in that my zone too i can say never plant in april some people swear by mother day here in ohio but i always do the first week of may no issues yet knock on wood i always check the forecast in depth before deciding when
gardening,in any online hobby group you get folks that are really passionate sometimes i feel that passion is hyper focused yes i used them yes i feel they safe to use if you have a baby you can steal them from a clean diaper lol do go overboard with adding them water them first before mixing to see how your mix is going the idea is that the roots are going to reach right into them to find moisture reserves
gardening,viola sp violets
gardening,eek put mine on a windowsill in the sun bad idea
gardening,i feel like it really depends on the person personally i hate getting houseplants cause i have shit lighting in my house and always kill them however i be thrilled to get a native perennial for the garden even then you might wan na just ask what they like some people me are kinda particular about what they plant
gardening,howdy from deerfield as well ive been jealously eyeing everyones amazing magnolias
gardening,you get to decide how big your plants will get if you want them to stay in this pot then prune them regularly to size i prefer glazed pots like this because it looks nicer and can feel more pulled together in your home some people prefer the wild look and grow in traditional unglazed terra cotta and let their plants just keep growing as big as they want both are good options it s entirely up to you
gardening,it s amazing but probably inedible
gardening,i feel this selling my house and i currently
gardening,i love this
gardening,congrats is it hard to remove what type of covering is that
gardening,i read that covid lockdowns meant a lot less pollution last year so more uv light got through so the plants are just going wild pollen levels are insane this spring
gardening,texas same we had a cold front come through yesterday and it dropped to my rain barrels were completely dry until we got a of rain last week we could use more
gardening,so pretty
gardening,this is beautiful but wait you have a peony field a field
gardening,oooh violets o okay thank you
gardening,that will help i put down a lil cardboard on top of the weeds first though
gardening,this is accurate
gardening,i would plan on second week in may but keep an eye on the forecasts i follow a couple meteorologists in my area that often put our garden based forecasts around that time can be very helpful if you go on the earlier side just be prepared with a plan to cover up in case of emergency i usually wait until week past average frost but have gone sooner
gardening,how does a graph work with tomatoes though a graph is on paper
gardening,your secret is safe with me nothing worse than the smug look on their face that says i told you so
gardening,exciting that i can eat them i had recently heard you can eat glechoma hederacea and part of my posting this was so i could get a name and look into if i could eat this too xd
gardening,roots grow from the root apical meristem from the root tips if there is no meristem there is no root
gardening,my man in the future with his beefsteak kush
gardening,thought this was
gardening,aren t dogwoods the most beautiful sight
gardening,ooooh i see violets okay then
gardening,i feel this also it made me feel like a dummy i order plants from breck and i was annoyed that they delayed shipping them to me until early may not annoyed enough to complain to anyone but my husband then i read the note with my order that said they send plants at the optimal time to get them in the ground looking at all the snow we got the past few days they were right and i was wrong like usual but do tell my husband i said that
gardening,looks like violets my whole back yard is covered in them you can eat them
gardening,i kinda doubt it it in the cashew family so maybe another member of the same family mango cashew etc or a more desirable sumac like lemonade berry rhus integrifolia also the sumac fruits themselves are edible
gardening,wild violet
gardening,anybody
gardening,that nice of you
gardening,very nice i went with painted red rocks in the strawberry patch and that worked for a few weeks till they learned
gardening,thanks i am happy i managed to get some
gardening,i had been thinking it was glechoma hederacea ground ivy but i recently noticed how different it really looks from the pictures of glechoma hederacea i can google up still quite similar maybe this is something related
gardening,problem with san diego is that the weather is so nice and consistent that when it drops degrees f you literally freeze to death san diego is slowly turning you into a lizard
gardening,deerfield is a beautiful little corner of ma miss that area so much
gardening,i had this problem last year as well at each node where the leaf meets the stem there are dormant buds that will wake up once the stem has been topped off higher up and i think you might have enough leaf growth to get it to bloom i would leave these outside and water them normally but try to put some around them good luck
gardening,wrong and you right texas wrong and you right wrong and you right wrong and you right wrong and you right wrong and you right cornell wrong and you right penn state wrong show me where they say that herbicides are pesticides just one show me where one of them say that herbicides are pesticides
gardening,it could be a witches broom mutation on cherry trees these are usually caused by insect or animal damage to the tree and a fungal infection called taphrina as a horticulturist i quite keen on them as you can sometimes get really interesting mutations that are worth propagating however i ca tell from the photo of this a broom mutation
gardening,my instinct is that the unflowering branch was grafted onto this tree at some point in its life
gardening,lol yes also my favorite brand
gardening,i successfully rooted rose cuttings without root hormone for transplanting cutting them early in the spring when they are full of vigor and vim seems to work well
gardening,just found one of my wooden bird feeders laying on the ground broken today i filled them all yesterday lol walking through i found a nice sprout in the garden bed all by itself two weeks ago my hubby built a flower bed that i exclusively planted at least fourteen different types of sunflowers in no sprouts yet i hope the little buggers and birbs did have a buffet on them
gardening,we in zone and usually plant outdoors around memorial day
gardening,op had a stroke
gardening,i know this is a gardening group but i still in shock by how many backyard beekeeper hives are stollen every year i have hives in my garden i ca imaginen a theif walking through my backyard to get super heavy mad stinging boxes but it becoming more and more common
gardening,awww i jealous looks so cute
gardening,came here to say this tomatoes have very similar needs to cannabis you can even graft them onto one another root stocks if you feeling creative
gardening,maybe drill holes in the bottom if you can and make it a normal planter
gardening,gardening in whatever form with kids is such a beautiful shared experience my kids are teens now and couldn t care less but they and i have a lot of good memories of when they d lug leaf mold to mom in the garden or find the cucumbers that stayed hidden treasure these little seemingly innocuous they build into happy memories
gardening,pretty where i live they say spring wo come until it snows on the dogwood blooms
gardening,i have used it successfully on weed clones and also rose clippings tried it on redbud tree clippings with no success
gardening,indeed it is
gardening,tomatoes are pretty similar once they start to grow up you can also train them and feed very similarly
gardening,the main benefit of having no winter i would imagine would be the part where winter does happen i not jealous or anything i just going to be over here pining for heat
gardening,i had bamboo in my yard in washington state
gardening,i agreeing with you you are right and everyone else on the planet is wrong thank you for enlightening us your wondrousness
gardening,there a rather big difference between a homeowner putting down weed killer every few years on a small lt acre property and a massive commerical agribusiness dousing their entire farm every year anyways this stuff is working great on the creeping violet star of bethlehem so i completely recommend it for addressing common lawn weeds
gardening,thank you i can t ever remember them flowering and they must have been here for like years they do look like peonies i must admit i suppose we will see this summer
gardening,my squash have something like that on the outer edge of the leaves only though they have not gone outside yet either unfortunately my post never gained any traction on here when i tried to find an answer but hopefully your post will
gardening,you carefully separate them and bury them up to the leaves you can use the same solo cups or pots or whatever they are but i would wait till they have true leaves coming out first tomatoes root all along the stem so burying them deep gives you more roots it would be nice to give them more light too you might think about grow lights
gardening,my pea plants are starting to flower now have them in a milk carton in my window got some good sun lately here so they are loving life hoping to get some peas from it but it mostly for fun
gardening,if you are raising from seed in the house be sure to harden them off before planting slugs are a biggee and you can get slug pellets as for the other vermin not a big problem with flowers cats will dig and poop so you can spray on orange oil on the soil not the plants foxes are great encourage them i use fox urine for my veggies to keep the squirrels and chipmunks away birds are good as they eat bugs
gardening,our tree seems to have a bit at the top that does blossom the branches are denser but otherwise it looks healthy we were thinking about cutting that bit off as it appears to be a side branch but it is thicker than the true top
gardening,it a pimple squish it no i joke your monstera is acting as normal
gardening,i use it but i have it in several strengths which are used on different types of plants i also start all my cuttings in sand as opposed to soil i use hormex brand
gardening,thats good thanks for letting me know
gardening,ah thanks for your response he picked it because he knows i like to press little wildflowers never pressed anything as big as a tulip but i guess i try if it cant regrow
gardening,i would not use mercury because it a heavy metal and fairly dangerous you may want to see about contacting a plumber who might be able to send an auger or snake through the pipe i not sure which subreddit would be best to ask this question maybe plumbing
gardening,i just want to take off work and sit in your backyard
gardening,its great for soil building if all the parts have been put in but can take years to be true soil where there most possible nutrients and minerals are available
gardening,my immediate first thought is where are you that putting mercury into your water supply is a go to plan second thought is the common way i would see where i at to do this stick a hose connected to a pressure washer to the bottom of the well run it until mud stops coming out of the top another option is to suck the mud out with some kind of sludge or slurry pump
gardening,some self water planters dont have drainage or the drainage they have is more like an over flow drain on a bath tub rocks and sand can help with drainage but idk how the will work in your planter good luck
gardening,wrong and you right texas wrong and you right wrong and you right wrong and you right wrong and you right wrong and you right cornell wrong and you right penn state wrong show me where they say that herbicides are pesticides just one show me where one of them say that herbicides are pesticides i sure as we sit here every dictionary on the planet is being edited to suit you tripling down now impressive
gardening,that happens half the time here too but this year has been glorious here never got nippy or too windy
gardening,if you are trying to harden off the seedlings i recommend cloudy weather for the first time you take them outside and only an hour at first you need to acclimatize the seedlings to the outside environment and from the effects of the sun
gardening,can t wait for mine to get that tall
gardening,yep i would say repot them as soon as possible
gardening,just iphone in slomo the light was nice i got lucky
gardening,i give up princess your right and the dictionary wrong wrong and you right texas wrong and you right wrong and you right wrong and you right wrong and you right wrong and you right cornell wrong and you right penn state wrong and you right i sure as we sit here every dictionary on the planet is being edited to suit you and every institution of agricultural research and education on the planet is now scrapping tens of millions of man hours of research thanks to you

gardening,no it ca but it will regrow next year from the bulb if all the foliage is missing i sure they will forgive him i actually let young people come into my yard and cut flowers tulips and daffodils for their parents they come in and pick a couple on their happy and on their way
gardening,haha sorry i want either i just get annoyed when people insist it is x without giving any reason or saying what they think it is tbh it does look a bit like sweetgum hard to say without seeing leaf arrangement knowing where op is surrounding plants etc
gardening,take another pic when the bins are put away for the full effect
gardening,sorry it s not the flower is a temporary part of any plant but fortunately the plant is fine without it it will regrow another flower next year so long as the squirrels don t eat the bulb
gardening,no need for that when there a few bird feeders in the yard and you watch the squirrels bury the seeds i have tiny sunflower sprouts all over the yard too bad they be chopped when grass is mowed
gardening,i love desert plants after the big storms in el paso the mountains overlooking bliss would turn purple from the blooming desert flowers wish i had pictures
gardening,i like it too i love floral dresses i all about that mid alternative look even though i always been living in a cottage is my dream haha along with a touch of decor food forests greenhouses gardens of all kinds everywhere and i be in heaven
gardening,noice good luck with your gardening
gardening,yes i know it cool i planted basil once with degrees celsius and it sprouted the next day
gardening,this happened to my mature apple tree last year i think it s powdery mildew eventually the leaves turned brown and died before the end of the summer i read spraying it with milk can help but i m not sure it actually did much for mine one of the causes as i understand it is letting the plant get too damp or not having good air circulation around it
gardening,big tough guy lol
gardening,oh i did even realize that it will last more than one season can i just leave it outside during winter on my balcony and it will do its thing once it spring
gardening,they can handle freezes ok i usually cover them if a freeze is coming we had a few freezes just this week and my radishes are looking good good luck
gardening,beautiful enjoy your hard work
gardening,too much water are there drainage holes in the bottom there should be
gardening,well we have tons of shade it just dry shade so i guess we are half way there thanks for the recommendations
gardening,i just got the same raised bed do you like it
gardening,oh no i fit into a stereotype for once i never heard of this
gardening,some sort of fungus or spider mites
gardening,thanks everyone i guess i know for sure when it fruits
gardening,this is off topic but i used to wear those gloves for work had to have them on all day pretty much i started to get a rash on my hands thought it was dry skin so i d pile on the lotion then put on gloves that didn t help and it was getting worse turns out you can be allergic to nitrile so now i have to go out of the way to get latex gloves my one point to allllll of this is latex keeps out more capsaicin than nitrile does sorry for the ramble but your gloves brought it all back
gardening,beautiful but our freeze in michigan killed my magnolia blooms just as they were getting going wahhhhhh
gardening,i put some peas in the ground like a week and a half ago and they sprouted in literally days
gardening,i live in texas and when the heat hits hard in the summer i let one of the stronger suckers grow and cut the main stem all the way back by the time it starts to cool that sucker is it own main stalk and fruit starts producing it was fruiting right up until the frost hit i think in a warmer climate i could have kept those bad boys going strong for a long time
gardening,gives an idea i would have had to cover my beans from snow if i waited until the lilacs went to full bloom on the other hand pretty sure blueberry bushes and strawberries will always need to be covered in a sudden frost
gardening,it almost looks like powdery mildew to me but it seems a little early in the year for it if it is though you need a fungicide spray
gardening,good luck with your plants still jealous
gardening,all my landlord does is send incompetent contractors who spray driveway tar all over my yard and dig up some of my plants to lay pvc pipes
gardening,i m in hatfield and the forsythia in this area are crazy this year
gardening,not at all i dont know which climate you have but here avocados grow vigorously and this one already has thick trunk so i didnt support it
gardening,that awesome they came back especially since you overwintered in one last question did you soak the tuber before planting i seen lots of tuber prep advice and my experience ends at dahlia tubers which essentially require only being planted in the ground
gardening,how was this shot it beautiful
gardening,hi neighbor i m in hatfield wasn t yesterday the weirdest
gardening,my lucky bamboo is getting little black spots on the stalk and i not sure what it is close up does look like insects but i would rule out a fungus the stalks are also dried out at the tops but still grow leaves the plant lives on my desk does get direct sunlight and sits in water mostly tap but i just learned about the issue with that i change the water every week or so my wife wants me to cut off anything that is green but i do want to do too much
gardening,the us is the same but with more fires so we have seasons
gardening,yea i m in florida where its either beaming you with sun rays or it s raining so hard you can t leave the house so it s makes things easy to grow
gardening,i have a large gardening plot in my backyard that is always overrun with weeds it a full time job just keeping them under control i want to start planting stuff there but i new to gardening and am taking it a few at a time so adding stuff year to year in the meantime is it ok to just order some bulk wood chips and cover the entire area with them including surrounding existing plants to protect them is this best practice or is there a better way to handle this
gardening,i know because i so excited about my garden i overwatered my kale and all the bottom leaves turned yellow i stopped and a week later it poppin
gardening,i attempting zinnias from seed for the first time and someone told me they just scatter the seeds before a rain which seems brilliant it supposed to rain tomorrow but will probably be a decent washout would you till and scatter still or would you wait and scatter after the rain when the ground is soft if it matters i in and we have the red clay soil hence the tilling thanks in advance
gardening,thanks friend
gardening,i will be container gardening in fabric bags for the first time this year our summers can get quite hot and all the research i done indicates the main problem in having tomatoes etc grow in them is that they do hold moisture as well i be mixing in coir vermiculite etc to try to balance the moisture issue wanted to know if anyone here has used the hydrogel granules like moist for food plants do they work is it safe i seeing conflicting info online
gardening,yes and same
gardening,thanks that s really useful to know i ll find a good spot indoors
gardening,i growing also myself in zone lol the sun makes miracles for my energy and inspiration people are nice friendly happy following slow life i do need to wear tons of annoying clothes i do love zones not only because of gardening it a real paradise
gardening,is it snowing there too
gardening,do you have more info on this are you saying plastic marked specifically with the recycling logo with the number in the center
gardening,ground up coconut husk plants were purchased from another greenhouse they have been chilled in a freezer for a certain amount of time
gardening,yeah should be fine i put my jiffy pods in a closed dresser drawer until they pop once they re almost touching the lid then they get light
gardening,my pleasure
gardening,i meant to say the third photo any help is much appreciated
gardening,okay thank you the soil temperature is around and weather is i ll keep them inside in a shady warm spot then
gardening,strawberry and way more lettuce
gardening,if you put that in direct sun the temperature will jump super high and everything inside will cook you want calm warm and dark if nothing has sprouted yet
gardening,nope we have lights over the lettuce for dark days
gardening,yes it has been leaking all dow the side and attracting ants friends bees split her hive waiting on new queen and box hive
gardening,get that guy in the ground they do best when directly sowed
gardening,i want to be there
gardening,i would just double their pot size or put them in the ground then just have a sunflower cluster their leaves get so big that they won t be fighting for sun root space is where the battle will be
gardening,beautiful i have one just like it on second year now i saw youtube video that seeds don t produce same fruit as donor so we ll see
gardening,there are stinkey sprays that keep em from eating plants neighbors here use them
gardening,thank you i ll cut back too bad i just watered them before the picture
gardening,i love being in zone where i can basically grow anything
gardening,the mice they take one bite and move on to the next
gardening,i just ordered some seeds from amazon it was about for seeds but there were actually about seeds in the bag i did seeds because it still a bit early to take cuttings from a plant i already have but we just put up some fencing and i want to get it covered as soon as possible so i did want to have to wait to make cuttings you can get the little pods of dirt at most bigger department stores walmart has then if you in the us you just moisten them until they all soggy then place your seeds on top and cover lightly with soil keep it inside by a window and mist them twice a day
gardening,thanks for the tip
gardening,to the person reading this to skippy you have my sincerest sympathy read this to him again real slowly do read him that part not that hard for the rest of us noun pesticide plural noun pesticides a substance used for destroying insects or other organisms harmful to cultivated plants or to animals noun herbicide plural noun herbicides a substance that is toxic to plants used to destroy unwanted vegetation but i sure the dictionary is wrong and you right
gardening,how is it self watered
gardening,i pretty sure they are dwarfs i think the packet said they can grow up to feet
gardening,what a lame neighbor there are no fences in my neighborhood and it been a struggle keeping my plants safe from the deer
gardening,it was raining a lot
gardening,yahhh mine are your standard pear size we are pretty sure it an anjou tree they called it a winter pear basically have to put them into the fridge for a few weeks and then bring them back up to to get them to ripen my hubby says the blooms smell pretty and i swear it smells like someone opened a bag of pork rinds all that matters is the bees love it
gardening,it was hovering around freezing
gardening,that a great idea thank you
gardening,i found that the bottle feeder on those things suck so i just sprinkle sugar and pollen powder in the hive and call it a day they do the rest good luck and what an exciting time
gardening,join us on
gardening,please tell me your process my star jasmine died in the freeze would love to grow new ones
gardening,that must be such a rollover coaster i m in southern california so can t even wrap my head around that
gardening,depends on what kind they are if they re skyscrapers you might be in trouble but dwarfs you re fine
gardening,they may make it but will definitely be behind the ball last year rabbits and deer completely deleafed a couple hibiscus plants i had i vowed to save them and by the end of summer they were full of leaves again and i had some blooms more importantly you need to plan on protecting them from the next attack makeshift chicken wire or welded wire cylinders almost become invisible from a distance once their brand new sheen wears off so that could be an option
gardening,probably do well people plant them for deer plots in the south and they grow really densely together always reaching for the sun
gardening,do feel bad if you have to start seeds again outdoors after your last frost morning glories seem to really grow in a hurry from seed once the weather is right for them i always wait and start mine outdoors even though it feels like it to do that
gardening,i brought it a day ago
gardening,as long as you identify as a professional right lol
gardening,if im not mistaken this is from over watering
gardening,double frosts took out my grapes and nasturtiums along with some coleus hate late frosts
gardening,peppers prefer slightly more shade in the afternoon or they risk getting sunburnt and i seen herbs grown under house lights that did just fine so to be honest as long as they are growing and healthy you have no reason to change anything
gardening,how do you think they would do if i transplanted all three to a gallon pot i been really pleased with sunflowers as a new gardener they make me feel successful
gardening,sunflowers are transplantable they sell them smaller in pots up here
gardening,satisfying watching friends family including the dog sneak into the garden to steal fresh fruit veg frustrating lt this jerk right here
gardening,never sprayed it the only time i added it to a raised bed i just hand sprinkled it in amounts recommended seems like it would clog the sprayer unless way diluted interested to know as well
gardening,no dig no till deep mulch gardening it all the same name for the practice of disturbing the soil as little as possible and instead adding layers of carbon and organic material on top
gardening,hi from sunderland beautiful yard so glad we ve had a long forsythia season this year
gardening,cheers you guys are awesome so what part would i eat if i ever was feeling adventurous enough to try it
gardening,ssssnek
gardening,we bought a couple of columbines on clearance one year and they have been spreading like crazy started a different variety from seed and filled in holes in front beds between those and hosts our beds are full now of perennial goodness columbines rock
gardening,oh my god that gorgeous
gardening,first harvest no winter didn t know that
gardening,i do know what selfwatering style is they have drainage higher up than the bottom and inserts that keep the soil up above the water at the bottom i do use the fill tubes that some come with i just water them as normal and the excess stays in the bottom the ones you see were probably not engineered correctly or whatever all i can tell you is i never had a problem except one time when i did set one up right correctly and it flooded during a deluge that was funny in hindsight
gardening,nice looking gymnosperm your face was just like mine i was expecting something more tree like so disappointed
gardening,i a bit late but there are white watermelons as well i grew a yamato cream watermelon that was a creamy color inside with a light green exterior best tasting watermelon i ever grown
gardening,is this narnia
gardening,that is absolutely amazing they inching close to the tree tops
gardening,i going to try and grow some monster pumpkins this year in my front yard i worried they will get large enough to be a target
gardening,totally should be able to transplant into their own pots or the ground just bury the roots well and water them in hardy dudes
gardening,i ve been propagating succulents i love to s u c c
gardening,yeah musk is stinky and if one gets in your house expect more they follow the trail of others had an issue with snakes at last house cat would always catch them and play with em finally fixed crack
gardening,oh that good news and i do mind watering every day i like checking on my babies often
gardening,i trying so hard not to make an off color year old humor comment
gardening,i was told that the secret to getting bluebirds is to put a lot of boxes up close together i put them feet apart the idea is that bluebirds move into the first box sparrows kick them out the bluebirds move into the next box the sparrows do care as long as sparrows do live right next door and so on nobody moved in maybe too close together hoping for second brooders now
gardening,i had no idea they were that big absolutely lovely
gardening,i think they ll be okay when my sunflowers are done and i pull them out i m always surprised at how shallow the roots go i mean you ll have to water probably every day but as far as space for the roots they ll do all right
gardening,oh my i would have done the same gorgeous
gardening,omfg i did not know i needed that sub until now thank you kind stranger
gardening,paw paw
gardening,gregor mendel has entered the chat
gardening,deer always eat my sunflowers we have been planting mexican sunflowers and grow them behind electric fence but the deer reach over and pull them down into fence hate deer neighbor feeds them
gardening,in my defense i really did expect germination i wonder if i can transplant i saw someone here with a similar issue yesterday
gardening,did it get hit by frost
gardening,sprout to make me act up
gardening,it grows to tall i hope you have a very large yard it takes allot of water and has large root spread make sure not near underground or overhead lines
gardening,guys don t upload such videos i have a heart problem and almost getting hearth attack after watching it
gardening,is it treated lumber if so it not safe for foods you plan to consume
gardening,nice
gardening,weirdly enough eastern garter snakes are venomous but their fangs are so far back it makes them practically incapable of delivering venom on most limbs since they re so small and even then it s very actually dangerous to humans
gardening,i love this so much i wanted to do this with a canoe or a small boat for so long now i just ca seem to find the right one but this is stunning
gardening,south australian here heading into the cold of autumn and winter
gardening,i hope so i ended up covering this patch bc we were suppose to get nasty wind
gardening,people from sacramento were saying they got a loblolly pine which gets to tall for most residents that is definitely not going to be able to planted they would have been better off doing something like a tiny crepe myrtle
gardening,yeah that does sound nice lol
gardening,al
gardening,with perennial stuff the saying goes year they sleep second year creep and third year they leap patience is key also slap some mulch in that bed it look good and the plants will thank you
gardening,what planet
gardening,haha
gardening,zone only tells how cold your winters get it does tell climate where are you located
gardening,i bought a beautiful new dogwood from my local small garden shop for a lot of money the same year i also bought a lowes distressed dogwood the damn expensive tree died and the lowe tree looks great so far in happiest with my box store beauties
gardening,they actually do have venom your skin will swell if they bite you but not much it s like the difference between the venom of a black widow and the venom of a daddy long spider similar but won t cause life threatening affects the worst part is their i don t fuck with them anymore
gardening,they like cool moist shade plant lots of tall grassy things like siberian iris daylilies peonies this gives them cool dark jungles at ground level to patrol and sleep in
gardening,video was too short did finish
gardening,i do know exactly how big my plants will get it possible to look up mature size on the internet what are you growing an expensive terracotta pot is going to work any better than a cheap terracotta pot clay is clay no matter who made it or how or how it painted or glazed a lot of this is advertising puffery the clay is of high quality this pot will last the test of time what damages clay pots other than dropping them is the freezing and thawing of winters water molecules inevitably trapped within the porous clay expand with freezing and crack the pot so an expensive clay pot is necessarily going to be any better at withstanding a severe winter than a cheap one would the high density of the clay makes the pots frost resistant note that they do specify frost proof or will not crack that because they ca guarantee that it advertising puffery no more if you want pots that you can leave outside all winter long you looking at something like a large wooden or concrete planter not individual pots made of clay or plastic also in severe winter areas you ca leave container plants outdoors anyway since once the root ball freezes the wind then sublimates moisture from them dehydrating and killing the plant so plants that need a winter chill period for bloom are protected for the winter in one of two ways either you sink the pot in the ground in a sheltered area up to the rim and then mulch over it with a foot of loose straw or you place the entire pot once the plant has gone dormant inside an unheated garage or shed for the duration
gardening,air root it will keep growing to help support the plant structurally direct it into the dirt or cut it off
gardening,most horrible smell on the planet is their musk
gardening,it s an aerial root
gardening,good catch and congrats on the upcoming kid also seedlings may be carrying stuff like spider mites or other critters from the outside that could contaminate an indoor growing space if possible keep them separate from houseplants when doing the seedling shuffle
gardening,i come to a full stop and then i eat the cereal
gardening,it beautiful hollyhock jungle
gardening,first rule of long life and happiness is you can ignore any study done by a moron that thinks herbicides and pesticides are the same thing and say herbicides are the most widely applied type of pesticides you know what worse than ignorance arrogant ignorance pesticide is the broad category for things used to control pests insects are pests and they controlled with insecticides fungus are pests and they controlled with fungicides so what do you use to control pests that are weeds or plants you use herbicides herbicides are pesticides they a type a subset
gardening,nobody moved in are they too close together maybe i was hoping you had birds in all your boxes because i like to get more than one nesting pair along our fenceline but i heard they pretty territorial and you do want them too close to each other or too close to other birdhouses or bird feeders
gardening,aww i need some my yard is infested with slugs
gardening,it s a loblolly pine
gardening,all about that bass about that bass
gardening,they wish lol
gardening,it threw me off cause it almost looked like a larvae or some kind but i guess it a root is it because the plant is not deep enough is there anything i should be doing thank you
gardening,figs do excellent in pots but are quite thirsty so careful in very sunny locations without drip lines or frequent watering
gardening,ants are usually harmful to plants and actually help keep aphids and other nuisances away if that a problem where you are if you have a colony of ants something nearby is feeding them they like sugar can you take away their food source if you want to get rid of the ants wear gloves and repot the plant toss away the old pot with the ants in it you can also use food grade diatomaceous earth which is a pesticide powder but still very gentle and sprinkle it around the bottom of the pot you can find this in most hardware stores hot pepper powder like cayenne or cinnamon will make it unpleasant for them but it wo kill them you can pour boiling water over the colony which will kill the ants but it will also kill the plant
gardening,i almost always use nurseries i do have a bunch of seeds i need to start for veggies but flowers i almost always cheat
gardening,oh what do they eat if they do have poison
gardening,ugh the audacity luckily here where i live all gardens are fenced so there s no chance of someone casually coming in and stealing stuff unless you re planting on your front door which is also pretty common but this doesn t stop some people to steal flowers from cemeteries which has happened to me a couple of times already someone in the neighborhood had also planted some beautiful pansies under some small public trees in front of their house and after a couple of days there was already a sign up because someone had stolen some
gardening,well it exactly like asking would you spend money on fill in the blank with name of expensive consumer good cars shoes food hookers and blow it all the same type of decision value for money is a highly personal benchmark that everyone draws in a different place conspicuous consumption is also a factor as always pretty good looking planters that are also high quality it depends on how you defining high quality it holds the potting soil and the plant in position the same as a plastic bucket would and it can be a very high quality plastic bucket a good utility bucket none of your cheap mop pails or upcycled ice cream tubs but still not really sure if it worth spending so much money on one of those if you have to ask how much it costs then you ca afford one my specific observation in this case would be that they all break the same when you drop one i rather drop a plain clay pot than a designer pot
gardening,yea my coworker almost saw that was close
gardening,may you have a blessed day
gardening,these are the non venomous gartner snakes all across america you can pick them up by tail when not mad i left them be
gardening,beautiful didn t realise this was yours
gardening,wow this was intense i was sitting at the edge of my seat the whole time
gardening,i d like to know as well mine arrives today
gardening,they eat slugs those needle teeth are there just for display purposes you need those to grab onto a slug
gardening,what do you mean by no dig
gardening,siting with you in waiting for the snow we supposed to get today and monday
gardening,did you kill it or are they friendly
gardening,actually it a mere statement devoid of any attitude
gardening,wanted to say your memory of peony posts make me so happy every time i see them such diverse and beautiful flowers thanks for sharing
gardening,this is what i did and said several weeks ago when i decided it was nice enough to bring the pepper starts outside i lost all but two after a light cold snap they still out there and going strong even after it got down to two nights ago i sad but started new seedlings and am going to protect them with fervor until like may i not losing my heirloom korean peppers again
gardening,she a beauty
gardening,hmmm i got them in containers actually and since they are shade plants i got the containers in the shade would it help them along if i put containers in the sun until they do sprout edited to add i am new to plants and this is my first year i never done caladiums
gardening,spring is not here until walmart fills up the pallets in the parking lot with bags of mulch then the rush is on so not spring so far where i am
gardening,that sounds like so much more fun not to mention revenue than a lemonade stand
gardening,if you have sprouts pushing through then it not such a dense crust that sprouts ca push through a lot depends on the composition of your soil since this is year two and you still amassing data on your particular conditions i just leave it to run and see what happens and then you know seeds have been pushing through crusted soil for millions of years without any help the same way that a tree can send roots into a driveway or sewer line a millimeter at a time a seedling can push through crust a millimeter at a time
gardening,mom seems to be a grass snake not the same species
gardening,damn looks like groot gf
gardening,i wish i had this problem i on season or with my navajo variety and it still just a couple canes coming out of the original stump i think it just in too shady of a spot
gardening,thank you so much for your response i hold off and give them some time
gardening,as a novice gardener i love it i m curious what experienced gardeners think of it
gardening,note that frost hardy only goes down to about it no guarantee against a hard freeze that is colder than that they can tolerate light frosts is all carrots beets turnips parsnips lettuces greens spinach chard peas radishes all the cole crops broccoli cauliflower others grow bags are most relevant during hot summers since they dry out faster than the ground
gardening,it going to be a good year my wife is potting our succulents that started escaping their habitat the bloobs are coming in strong and will ripen soon
gardening,what a cutie
gardening,a fucking bonsai has a better ass than me i out
gardening,the leftmost are probably salvageable they still got enough growth to maintain energy production for new leaves i would take a wait and see approach give them a few days of close monitoring and see if any new leaves start to form transplanting them now while they vulnerable could easily cause then to shock and die
gardening,so ive been going to alot of nurseries and plant places and i notice the bonsais are exremelty expensive for decently sized ones like to dollars as much as id like to think big boxes like lowes feel amature they have the biggest cheapest bonsais and i keep buying them there they have a great selection and really nice big ones for dollars ones i may pay a for elsewhere so i buy my bonsai at lowes when they go on sale we get them for dollars i normally cant even buy the big bonsai dish size they give you with it for or less dollars normally around to alone i actually got a fig bonsai about twice the size with times the trunk for that dollar price our ficus bonsai clippings weve been taking have been growing like crazy fast on clones
gardening,it was like being in a giant snow globe i love when that happens the sun came out a few minutes after this but it kept snowing anyway
gardening,lots of things can cause burnt edges overwatering underwatering sunburn windburn herbicides insecticides fertilizer burn we ca troubleshoot until you tell us your procedures pictures would be helpful
gardening,ooh baby
gardening,even better you can graft and grow your own even those stocks could have something better grafted onto them
gardening,it is okay to whine are they in the ground or in containers how long have they been in the ground or did you overwinter them they go by soil temperature not air temperature the soil warms up independently and cumulatively as the sun shines on it every day so they can conceivably sprout in warm soil but then come out into freezing temps
gardening,zone over here waving to everyone else who had snow today hi
gardening,i see the really pale ones looked deeply shocked but with normal care and time i do see why they should make a full recovery light warmth nutrients and watering but not overwatering plus time are what they need so really just back to basics for a while and give them time do repot them it a lot of stress just food water light and let them alone there are soil temperature maps online you can also touch base with your local county master gardeners for a planting schedule google name of state cooperative extension and look around for a list of counties they usually have these posted online as articles or pdfs
gardening,if you growing in the ground try mulching all around them with of good compost it the best tip i ever got here made a huge difference in my particular situation
gardening,collard greens mizuna corn salad radishes work for us under hoop covers
gardening,even at speed those flakes were coming down so surreally yesterday i was so confused i had those flakes but and sunny and got worried there was a fire nearby that it was ash and not snow
gardening,you can change that good pruning fertilize on years that bloom and do when not i got a yo tree to go back to every year
gardening,how you gon na post a pic of something so tasty and not post the recipe you absolute monster
gardening,a sickle doesn t get the roots though don t they just keep coming back
gardening,well yeah but the hurricane season will be starting soon so i was really just asking in advance the winds this weekend made me think about what to do if something like that happens
gardening,tell me about it we had an unexpected frost recently because my state just does want me to grow peppers and basil apparantly because it was just those that died seriously the dill survived the strawberries were mad but they bounced back this was just a freeze it was a personal assault on my garden and ca get over it
gardening,question when you initially laid your first layer of mulch down did you sheet mulch to kill the grass or anything i am trying to do the same thing in my smaller raised bed garden area the grass is driving me crazy and growing very tall
gardening,northern us seasons as well it snowed in april yesterday come on april i thought we were past this
gardening,we are looking into putting mulch as a pathway around new raised beds do i need to put screening under it and is there a preference over nugget and shredded we will have a daughter turning one this summer want to see which is better for toddler and perhaps a better landing
gardening,so lush and colorful sometimes i wish my state was a little more green like that
gardening,southwestarizona here it does even rain been past few weeks
gardening,any bag rose i don t actually have this brand specifically just used it for the picture

gardening,lowe yes you hit the help me button you can you help with with some questions lowe oh no we just find that showing up and placating you is half the battle we actually have no idea what we doing let me look up your question on google
gardening,that s really lucky i have three that i planted a few years ago and so far they are staying very narrow i planted them in center they sell out online early everywhere so i haven t been able to get my hands on any more
gardening,so jealous they are my favorite i in hampden county now i never even see any bluebirds down here oh and your video is just beautiful april snow has never looked so pretty
gardening,literally something out of a bob ross painting
gardening,i love crabapples crabapple jam is the best
gardening,is it snowing or flowering
gardening,chicago has a very similar climate and meme but we currently transitioning into the pollening which comes just after third winter
gardening,is this real
gardening,is it ok to just whine because i feeling pouty because all this cool air means my caladiums will probably never sprout zone
gardening,it slo mo but otherwise percent happened irl
gardening,i put up boxes this year and the bluebirds were landing on them literally as i put them up nobody moved in
gardening,that is the face of dissapointment
gardening,the wind whipped this one around too but the flowers are holding fast
gardening,haha well as others have yep they smell like semen if you are familiar with that smell it kind of like a salty sweaty smell and another smell you ca place almost like walking past a fish store that has been recently cleaned with harsh chemicals now i a crunchy weirdo but these trees are invasive in my area i would cut it down faster than you could say honey i think hiring a professional to take it down that would actually be safer
gardening,fuck i eating that shit
gardening,should have seen the lil thing striking and hissing almost funny
gardening,more like rip their roof off pulling creeping charley and saw the mom run away kids were there ready to strike snakes in this pic
gardening,do reuse bottles for greenhouses cheap plastic number has been proven especially under heating and uv rays from the sun to leach plastic into the soil and plants
gardening,thank you i been hearing kale is great in cold weather ill have to buy some seeds

gardening,spinach kale beets carrots
gardening,i did add a fan days ago but maybe the flow was too strong i moved it back yesterday
gardening,very nice and reminds me that it really time to pot mine
gardening,i just stopped watching peppers that folks from zones moved outdoors life not fair definitely zone envy disorder mediterranean withdrawal syndrome
gardening,that is pretty pricey considering it s only in diameter that being said if you can afford it and you love it then i say go for it you ll have if for many years and will be able to transplant many plants in it over that time
gardening,likely leaf spot try to avoid getting the leaves wet my zinnias get it every year a little bit and still produce very well though
gardening,there needs to be a term for this zone envy i am open to suggestions but the internet definitely gives me zone envy
gardening,lol then there me secretly resenting people living in warmer climates
gardening,managing a garden well takes a ton of planning or more crops all with their own unique start dates requirements etc three seasons to garden through ordering seeds managing soil fertility dealing with pests ain t it great
gardening,stupid sexy flanders
gardening,i spend money on a pot i know i going to have and use for many years to come
gardening,water splashes can do that but bottom leaves often go a bit strange wait until the plant grows more leaves and first truss of fruit then you can just cut them off do check both sides of leaves for very small insects mite size and treat accordingly if you find any
gardening,no problem be warned it can be pretty humor but it one of my favorites
gardening,i am groot
gardening,thats what i was assuming lol
gardening,by the look on his face you interrupted his coffee
gardening,i have the same clematis recently planted
gardening,it a kardashian plant
gardening,i wouldn t consider that expensive at all if you want a pot to last especially outside it s worth it cheap pots always crack nice pots are a long term investment you don t have to transplant plants to bigger pots i often cut plants back to keep them a specific size just depends what you re going for
gardening,how dare you invade his turf
gardening,very nice
gardening,apples can be biennial bearers just google biennial bearers apples

gardening,the title of your post though totally thought the post was going be about cannabis as far as garden pots no usually i just use whatever i can get my hands on i personally try to avoid planting in pots as they need to be watered much more often vs planted in ground sometimes i buy silly looking pots with faces on them and stuff but that about it and i almost always buy my flower pots at the dollar store
gardening,i think it depends really i have a couple of vintage pots that i am in love with i have other pots that i feel a bit meh about the pots i love i will have for decades i hope they are as much of a feature as the plant inside them and i would search out a plant that fits them as soon as a plant has outgrown them worth every penny edit if you are not absolutely in live with the pot do spend the extra money some of my favourite pots are from ikea
gardening,those are seed leaves they yellow and drop normally

gardening,what i ve seen is that these containers end up with stagnant water sitting in the base it doesn t wick up into the soil if there is a rain event the water wouldn t wick you know it seems just as easy and efficient to just use a watering can and water the soil thoroughly from above in your photos i m not seeing that those containers are the style

gardening,yeah if age has taught me anything it is that life is too short to waste on bad quality plants if you want fruit that worth eating you have to go to a proper nursery and pay the price you only get that many growing seasons on this earth and i wasted too many on trees that were basically root stocks

gardening,i using a plant care app you only need to start it once d there are lots of them for free i can highly recommend it
gardening,hello i am not sure if it is a good place to write my message but i will give it a try does anyone know how to order these free catalogs the link is here from the united states to europe almost all of these companies declare on their websites that they are not able to ship their catalogs outside the us i find these catalogs to be very useful in a printed version because it is not only more convenient to have it at hand but also it is like encyclopedia that has a lot of inspiring and valued information and would help to plan our future garden since we do not have any friends or relatives in the united states i would like to know is there anyone who could help us with this question the ideal version would be to find a person who is planning to come to europe either to the united kingdom or norway from the us this year and could take these magazines with itself only in case there would be an extra space in the luggage but i am not sure whether it is the best idea if you have any suggestions i would be happy to hear it thank you

gardening,this is an aeroponic system no soil or overwatering for a reminder for anything outside of the system set yourself alarms on your phone with specific tasks pertaining to checking your plants or watering and build a routine alarms get annoying but it s helpful
gardening,did you harden your plants off before transplanting
gardening,i a newbie to all this but i did know that they were bulbs so i was thinking that hopefully that meant they would come back
gardening,yay
gardening,yay i have done the same for the first time it worked so well it still really early in the season here last frost is usually around may but so far spring has been really quite cold so i have mine inside and i pick off the flower buds still until i can move it outside
gardening,i like the sound of that i was just thinking if i was given a notification saying i need to water the plant that be useful i just worry i over water like i tend to do
gardening,i not had a lot of success with those actually the water never leaves the globes
gardening,stunning i thought this was the ghost of tsushima sub when i saw it
gardening,water perennials infrequently but deep to train their roots to go deeper in stead of watering a little bit very frequently i usually water my perennials once a week in summer if it hot except for newly planted stuff i moved a lot of stuff around last year so i think i might be able to get away with watering some parts even less since they now established containers do work like this since they dry out faster than soil those you need to water when dry this can be daily or even twice a day for small pots bigger pots can last a bit longer
gardening,i had the same thing i got some rubber snakes and a fake falcon which has helped a bit the main thing which helped was these yellow balloons with a pattern on them which freaks them out not sure of the official name of them though

gardening,also me watching the local squirrel dig up and eat my bulbs
gardening,just buy dwarf tomatoes then there would be little to no need to top them i known some people who managed to keep the same tomato growing for at least two summers so i bet that it very likely that they would at least survive all year long whether they produce all year long probably depends on conditions so that another question
gardening,sweeeet
gardening,damn those tulips look amazing i want some
gardening,the title sounds much more threatening than the main section
gardening,not necessarily the roots come out in search of water too so repotting is more of a proportion matter does the top growth look sad or as if it at least the size of the pot yes repot no do
gardening,careful strawberries and tomatoes are the gateway drugs
gardening,have you tried this type of salad before could just be a rather bitter variety

gardening,same in minnesota
gardening,try ollas they have saved my extreme texas garden
gardening,lavender should do just fine in a pot as long as you give it a lot of sun soil and be careful not to over water it i would keep in mind though that bees absolutely love it so if you scared or allergic to bees if you on your balcony a lot it might not be a super great idea
gardening,lavender does smell nice it will grow in a pot as long as you take care of it and i do think it will dislike a tropical climate you can use it to make lavender oil or put into little bags that will smell nice you can also eat the flowers to add a little flowery note to a dish or add the leaves in a stew
gardening,i got a freakin stevia plant
gardening,not snow but frost i draped drop clothes all over i warned my hood i hope they caught that

gardening,the free strawberry plant i got from them with their first give away is far closer to a fruit tree than this
gardening,if you have some extra lamps you can use white bulbs to help supplement the light if you happen to have a shop light you can always place them under it that should buy you a bit of time along with topping them so long as you do have a short growing season you can also plant them up to the first set of true leaves and any part of the stem that buried will grow roots the same holds true for tomatoes
gardening,some seeds that are in shells float an are still cilantro sunflower etc
gardening,thanks
gardening,cool did you get the seeds from a shop or did you germinate them from another strawberry also why coco and what exactly do you mean by coco does it have anything to do with the parts of a coconut thanks for your replies

gardening,i feel this hardcore chronic depression and anxiety for me
gardening,so i live in a pretty small town in florida and some local business owner has planted pansies outside their business some drunk girls on their way home from a bar stole them all but were caught on his camera and it made the paper and then was posted everywhere in local gardening groups i would have died of shame if i d made that bad of a choice and then was all over social media doing it pansies don t steal plants in my town we will find you

gardening,weed barrier and years and years of old mulch
gardening,i like that pot
gardening,carnation flowers
gardening,i ve read that the only way to kill it is to cut it back constantly and inject with syringe and needle roundup or stronger directly into the stem every time you do the cut back
gardening,yup i want to cry
gardening,first year with strawberries and so far one of my plants has two berries started and they both look normal the weather has been cooperative since i put them in the ground but both plants have taken off pretty well with lots of new growth no red in the berries yet but they still growing and i only had them in the ground for about a week i looking forward to the weather warming up to see how well they take off i been warned that strawberries produce better their second year and that i have to be vigilant in cutting them back because they can easily spread
gardening,what kind of seeds
gardening,i am in the uk and had a conversation with my mom about ve noticed some summer flowering plants have flowered the usual amount but definitely a few also last few years we ve had geraniums that do not seem to totally stop flowering at all i m wondering if the lines between seasns are blurring a little
gardening,come back if you have trouble and we ll brainstorm ideas for more light if needed
gardening,plants with umbels for flower heads help attract parasitoid wasps harmless little guys not the wasps you re used to that lay their eggs in aphids killing them you can also purchase the wasps and set them free in your garden
gardening,if the pots too big for the plant it can hold too much moisture and rot the plant before you gets a chance to use all of the moisture and nutrients in the media planting it in the garden is different to a pot and it wo rot unless you over water it but you wo be able to move it once its established and it may get to tall
gardening,i m growing pomegranate a lemon and an apple tree in socal this year all of them seem to be fine choices but we ll see how they turn out
gardening,me after sewing seeds and then seeing my apartment complexes gardener that steps on all my plants
gardening,you get what you pay for
gardening,is that bad i just water it once a week and leave it in indirect sunlight i dont fertilise it i only repotted it once by putting the plant w the original soil into the bigger pot of new soil
gardening,it might also be creeping bellflower i had what i suspected where wild violets but turned out to be creeping bellflower instead which i also found invasive and unbearable every piece of root that is left in the ground will sprout a new plant and the roots seem to break at a sneeze good luck i would just convert the lawn into a pollinator garden to save the headache i m not much for grass anyway
gardening,i do not know if anyone else here has observed this at your location but here in southern finland a few of us have discussed independent observation that the birch trees specifically but other trees additionally are not really dropping leaves nor are the leaves changing color to the degree that we would expect by now despite colder temperatures already it almost as though they experiencing the weather in a different manner somehow it somewhat strange
gardening,from that i guess you can just make candied juniper berries for the same effect
gardening,sorry for your situation i hope they a similar thing happened to me last year about a dozen cucumber plants peppers pea plants and at least cherry tomatoes all wilted and died our season is so short here so a snap like that wiped out a lot of the crops i like to for the year so i hope you are going to be but perhaps get some new seed sown asap so you have something prepped in case the worst should happen good luck
gardening,thanks for answering here you have a picture i dont know how many maybe a couple of them
gardening,phoenix area pots are bad for us in general the clay pots dry the soil quickly black pots are a solar over for the roots most plants like and can handle full sun when it isn t too hot under trick is making sure roots are watered deeply not just a sprinkle on the surface but that it penetrates with tomatoes a trick i have used to force the roots deep when planting is to pinch off all the leaves except the topmost all the hairs will turn to roots and i plant it all the way so the new top just sticks out unconventional but it seems to work for me with the warmer summer they needed some shade full shade will slow kill everything so i use a shade cloth and hang it over the entire garden no one will live exposed to heat for too long on those really hot days some extra humidity with a morning water helps too
gardening,i would sit and watch for hours
gardening,a bunch of crap seriously compost is a great thing because it s usually overlooked
gardening,well this made my day at in the morning dying
gardening,that not messy that a lovely quince
gardening,as a minnesotan i laugh and relate i hate most its usu big muddy puddles and cold miserable rain not very bright
gardening,olives maybe
gardening,i lived in denver for many years and that has the unfortunate complication of being closer to the sun being a mile high i would just offer as much shade as they ll tolerate probably year round i would focus on planting things so they at least get afternoon shade when the sun seems hottest water soil deeply early in the morning to prepare it for the day otherwise you might have blossom end rot on those tomatoes take time to harden off seedlings and plants even anything purchased for such extreme temps i like to direct sow i find the seedlings better prepared for the sun that way
gardening,as a new gardner in phoenix i feel for ya i think shade and location is all we can do you have about times as many plants as i though good luck
gardening,i definitely give them lots of soil are the pots big enough where you can just scoop the plant roots and surrounding soil out like do shake them out and expose the roots try to move it as a big heap then fill in the pot with the necessary soil and plop it back in does that make sense tomatoes and peppers are definitely sensitive to transplanting and shock easily so try your best to not disturb the roots and make sure they have plenty of water you do want them to wilt strawberries and herbs do really care so much
gardening,i not sure but my ghost peppers developed something that looks like this after i brought them indoors for the cold months it seemed to be a reaction to the change from sunlight to grow lights not saying this is what going on with your plant since it a different type of plant and i am no expert but i figured it was worth mentioning just in case
gardening,last week the same here and i still use a puffer jacket and central heating then i open reddit to see florida guys plants
gardening,hmm sounds reasonable thanks
gardening,basically everything else did actually all those plants were in the same bed i do know if they did get covered well enough but the peas and watermelon in the same bed seem to be doing okay
gardening,my tomatoes are starting to outgrow their indoor setting
gardening,we can t say for sure all you can do it try and see
gardening,if it s a pine tree all parts are edible
gardening,if im able to make it brighter i will be able to grow it here even without direct lights
gardening,it does look exactly like a baby loblolly pine from my area though i m sure lots of conifers look exactly alike this size they re growing wild all over the place here cracks me up that this was part of a fruit tree give away though material
gardening,looks too dark google the guy who made lights using bottles of water and bleach that might brighten it up
gardening,so like linden trees
gardening,what on urf
gardening,these are amazing
gardening,so i had to google what is edible from a conifer turns out the entire tree is edible still not what i d call a fruit tree
gardening,but if you were to accidentally tear off a lil part of the root depends on the stage and if it was the main taproot or not
gardening,i am aware
gardening,i think figs would do well too
gardening,hazel the seed really looks like a hazelnut and the leaves seem right
gardening,looks like a hazel tree
gardening,from one noob to another plant multiples of things strawberries peppers tomatoes etc my first year i planted only one of each and was super discouraged when each plant did survive or did produce or produced a disappointing amount next year i planted three of everything i wanted to grow and ended up with at least one of each plants happy and productive
gardening,yeah i definitely would prefer a dwarf variety since i be growing it in a container i heard pomegranates are a good option
gardening,yeah that looks like cilantro
gardening,i think there s a mexican plum variety that would work maybe pomegranates any dwarf species
gardening,those sounds like instructions to a very productive and healthy garden much like a baking recipe i feel like this may be only half of the equation whoever came up with this advice is very well seasoned for the area that they deal with
gardening,yes
gardening,i think a bit of the stigma comes from the facts that their products are a decent bit more expensive than the ones that are not treated by them they do grow exceptionally well and some people think it worth it for others it just unnecessary expense for me the difference is about so yeah i going to go for the miracle grow
gardening,it s not global warming it s climate change
gardening,i can imagine
gardening,especially when most gardeners are enthusiastic sharers love my sedum ground cover here have some having gopher problems i use daffodils as a natural deterrent when i dig them up this fall i ll set some aside for you i saved some of the seed from last years best tomatoes i know you were thinking about trying a few pots want some this enthusiastic potato came up in my compost bin who can give it a home i seeded too many basil plants save me from drowning in them this spiderwort came up in my garden path i love it but it can t stay here somebody want it i divided my rhubarb and now i have too many take some
gardening,i live in zone equivalent areas somewhere halfway across the globe my plants are still little seedlings or died before being mature enough to bloom

gardening,a storage unit of mine got robbed with my whole life in it tens of thousands stolen all childhood collections and personal memories gone police document it for insurance for the storage conpany they don t look for the criminal they don t care flowers are gone
gardening,awesome desktop background
gardening,this is insanely beautiful
gardening,of mine are just dead there this stupid bird that keeps tearing up my stuff and i have no idea what to do

gardening,just keep the plant inside
gardening,fuck blackberry bushes
gardening,thanks for the knowledge about fake bamboo good to know
gardening,lol same here
gardening,there plenty for all
gardening,meanwhile in wisconsin we just had another snow fall two days ago
gardening,i had no idea but good to know i ve been here my whole life and never knew very cool
gardening,i agree
gardening,i be over for dinner in minutes
gardening,it heart breaking hope they ok
gardening,that s such a great feeling and i m convinced the flavor of homegrown herbs is the best
gardening,just lovely
gardening,oh and a cocktail
gardening,we got a really short and mild winter this year i grateful for that
gardening,lovely colors on those tulips
gardening,awesome i m looking to propagate some cuttings into a hanging basket in my room right above this west facing window as well
gardening,yes lots are kept as houseplants
gardening,laughs in victoria british columbia
gardening,hmm i respect that
gardening,most citrus and some stone fruit will do well with good soil and adequate water
gardening,that s clever
gardening,and that is an attitude
gardening,ohhhh horsefly i see
gardening,i do think one week is going to make a huge difference they be fine
gardening,that is a fly
gardening,i heard primm has a new sheriff in town
gardening,it looks to me like salts oxidizing on the surface of the soil usually a sign of over feeding
gardening,seconded they ll hide on the undersides of leaves so take a peek and be ready with a spray bottle of soapy water
gardening,pacific northwest i probably could have started putting stuff in the ground in january honestly it was sooooo warm and only frosted a few more times after that it was just super wet and rainy zone
gardening,lol its cute yall think yall have a season called fire
gardening,this is art
gardening,san diego county here but raised in the desert it seriously gorgeous here like days out of the year and the other are mildly unpleasant at worst i am so spoiled
gardening,did you get some of that unseasonable snowmageddon weather that seems to have made certain plants around here go nuts this fall the roses around here are like nothing i ve seen before every single bush you can find is just loaded
gardening,just make sure it blooms at the same time
gardening,lichen does really damage a tree but they prefer to grow on either damp or older or sicker trees wo harm them but shows that perhaps the tree is in the best of health
gardening,this is great haha we get fall without pretty colours maybe slight frost sad spring with random frost surprise nice the extremely hot weeks regular fall
gardening,i signed up for the wildflower one i pretty sure i just going to get a regular seed packet
gardening,yes that exactly how i see my last frost date avg for me my plants wont go into the ground until the last weekend of may at the earliest there are soooo many locals with plants already in the ground here as it was hot a few weeks ago the local chats started blowing up freaking out over this snow and cold week or were just started duh it more then a month too soon to plant
gardening,indeed
gardening,here in the netherlands they start after the month fall in but then we had surprise winter we in barely spring now
gardening,a second one of these needs to be made for vancouver island we getting scorched here
gardening,i m sorry i haven t even looked to assess the damage i know i m gon na have to start all over again and i don t want to look at it right now i think we might be buying plants this year lol
gardening,i hope so they are in containers so i worry about their roots with extreme cold but never have had the stalks sprout before the freezes were over thanks it makes me feel a bit better that they are tough cookies
gardening,thank you very much for the info i have a small orange tree just beside this one with some lichen growing on it as well would that be a concern
gardening,thanks for the info much appreciated i have some lichen also growing on my small orange tree is there some concern in that case
gardening,you called
gardening,i think i can do without your fire season and water restrictions and blackouts because of worry about fire season
gardening,peonies are tough they ll do okay
gardening,what also is acknowledged is that construction season and winter last for about months of the year combined
gardening,i guess pine nuts are fruit now
gardening,haha yeah this checks out i hope we done with snow for now but you never know i always wait until victoria day to start gardening especially cold sensitive plants just in case last year some surprise cold in may killed my squash seedlings
gardening,plants in the us vs canada
gardening,thanks everyone
gardening,you ve described life in my garden precisely so disheartening to experience the spring rollercoaster somehow feeling especially painful this month
gardening,thanks dad
gardening,that looks like one of the trees i planted when i worked in forestry
gardening,ahh yes the notorious pine fruit tastey
gardening,tired me was like there no mulch in the raised beds oh the ground
gardening,good to know i give it a shot i totally with you i love our hairy flatmate but sometimes i just ca understand what going on between his lovely ears
gardening,seems like it good luck with your plants and i just may give them a second chance
gardening,i from minnesota but i identify with this so much
gardening,close to s town
gardening,ugh i have a plot in a community garden with locked gates so random people ca wander in but stuff still gets stolen it burns my biscuits that fellow gardeners are stealing from each other some people have no honor or decency
gardening,on the other hand the shitass weather means i got an extra week to assemble and install the raised beds
gardening,oh thank you i appreciate the information i need to rip this guy out
gardening,yeah we always called it wild viola it is very hardy with little bulbs underground and will establish beds that grow larger and greener leaves if you allow it a couple of years with more dense sprays of purple and white viola flowers i actually like it as a volunteer in some places and have allowed it to take over a nice patch around one of my maple trees and in another strip along the path next to my driveway by just not mowing it down it much more attractive than the dandelions and henbit that ca compete in the areas where it dominates and weirdly my dog sometimes seeks out the big green leaves for a salad snack
gardening,looks good just curious but why raise it off the ground
gardening,you re so welcome
gardening,if you look in your potting soil it should have more of these but with a more white color these are slow release fertilizers that are pre mixed into your soil the yellowing comes from oxidization
gardening,rooting for the derpy one
gardening,in years you get pine nuts also some parts are edible
gardening,pellets make for no more birdie
gardening,this but they actually do prefer a bit a dry to wet they hate wet feet
gardening,its not mine i just crossposted it but i agree
gardening,what are these small brown spots is it blight my tomatoes are grown inside with a grow light
gardening,do ever try to clean up the root ball you have one of two options almost no roots on your indoor plants and outdoor trees or completely root bound because they try to make the pot look full and healthy
gardening,this can be a sign of overwatering
gardening,my condolences for your plants frost dates are useful but they are often misinterpreted frequently when people look for their frost date they find their average last frost date since it an average fully half of years will have frost later than that frost free dates on the other hand mean that out of years you in the clear which is much more reliable that still leaves about one year each decade that will fuck you up and the cold snap last night might have made that shitty year in a lot of areas even besides the fact that frost dates are just probabilities they still leave a lot out when comes to planning when to put plants out a lot comes down to simply obsessively checking the weather and the rest is knowing your climate for instance my area southeastern pennsylvania has a similar average last frost date as southern iowa but we are a subtropical climate and they are a continental one which basically means their temperatures vary much more wildly sure iowa often gets some nice days in but a cold snap is not unheard of for them but here in sepa the risk of lows is basically over by early march the low temps we risk by planting on the early side are much more survivable than the late hard freezes that happen sometimes in the midwest last night was about as bad a late cold event as i seen but it only got down to when all was said and done so someone in iowa should proceed much more cautiously with regards to cold damage than people in my neck of the woods
gardening,we got a record freeze after our last frost date and i had to yank dozens of dead transplants out of the ground today
gardening,at first i thought it could have been a juniper but the needles are far to long that really just looks like a regular pine to me
gardening,ah next time i ll trim them they were really tasty tho
gardening,my daffodils that were planted years before i moved in are blooming does this count haha
gardening,this happens sometimes when strawberry plants get diseased if your leaves are yellowish and stripey and all your berries are coming out like that you may have a sick plant
gardening,at least in my experience the early ones are always a little small or shaped wonky i had one that was mostly normal but it was sooo tart they need that heat to get all tasty and sweet
gardening,not sure but i have it too
gardening,you can try to attract ladybugs with plants like marigolds chives dill etc but you can also go buy ladybugs from your local garden i ve even ordered them on amazon before you need more than a couple to handle an aphid issue
gardening,sitting here waiting for may as snowflakes still comin
gardening,well please feel free to message me i be happy to help you in your plant journey
gardening,i m thankful but also confused because i didn t plant a hosta in that pot
gardening,snowed today in zone canada lol plants are even outside yet
gardening,so funnily enough and maybe this work for you i planted a bunch of cold weather crops in a part of the garden and those have been just thriving with all of these weather changes i pretty sure where they are will also protect them from the heat for a reasonable amount of time
gardening,have paid for a single one all found on side of road or donated i tell everyone i know i need pots
gardening,planting this early dumb
gardening,this is how all of the nurseries here make their money for the year fool spring people buy some lovely flowers to cheer up the dreary yard because their perennials are smart enough to still be in the ground it hard to see the pretty flowers once they under a foot of snow once the snow melts the flowers are all plastered to the ground and not so pretty any more better go buy some more flowers spring of deception every nursery is selling tomatoes and peppers and squash to unsuspecting suckers they back two weeks later to buy more and maybe some of those fancy plant shelters rinse and repeat until june i stopped trying to plant anything outside before memorial day
gardening,wrapped em up in tarps too many to move inside lol
gardening,oh no i hate did anything survive
gardening,wish i had snow it deg today forecast for next week i hope my plants wo die of the heat
gardening,thank you i sit out there and space out lol
gardening,are the first one always weird like that because it is still too cold or they did get pollinated well or what i have seen too many bees out yet despite it having been during the day and the flowers out everywhere maybe i need to start my own little back yard hive
gardening,i cursed the sky
gardening,yes i agree the roots intertwine but they will come up by the root it is time consuming but worth not using pesticides
gardening,ours look the same way they should perk up just fine
gardening,oh and bok choy lol
gardening,i scared the cat laughing so loud at this i m in a constant battle with this one fucking scrub jay he tears through my plants gets dirt everywhere on the patio and buries his nuts which btw i m allergic to in my planters he ll land up in the tree and we ll give each other stink eye till one caves my cats bark only at this one damn bird they don t care about the others it s just this one fucking bird
gardening,japanese knotweed does look a lot like bamboo it also called japanese false bamboo this is definitely knotweed though the leaves are a giveaway
gardening,it s still back and that s something to celebrate
gardening,i unfortunately have learned this the hard way as well a few years back i live in mi where the weather can be super nice to snowing the same day it s been increasingly unpredictable the each year good ol warming i presume one year i thought we were good so as a somewhat gardening newbie i planted everything then there was frost for a week so the next year i waited another month to plant and yup another frost then last year we had an unexpected sudden hail storm that took out most of my veggies this year i ve been biting at the bit to start but temps dropped again we had snow so i m gon na wait till next month again
gardening,minnesota here and yes
gardening,contrasts i m so jealous of your mantis nest all i get is cicadas
gardening,who the hell downvoted this
gardening,many are saying it is a loblolly pine no label on mine though
gardening,i was gon na say are sunflowers perennial in some zones
gardening,the left one is obviously just going through his punk rock phase
gardening,just a side note i m from washington and we had a whole forest of bamboo around our property growing up it definitely grows there
gardening,worst tree ever for a giveaway at least i have loblolly pines growing wild
gardening,i promise this is not sarcastic but have you tried pulling it out at the roots this is the only way our yard has even slightly less weeds it s a pain but weed killer hasn t worked and it s the only thing that has consistently worked for me two hours in a saturday pulling out weeds and it s looking much better now my suggestion is really just to grab it by the roots and pull
gardening,i think this may be an all plant question but if you were to accidentally tear off a lil part of the root will it still be okay it looks beautiful i hope you get a bountiful harvest
gardening,if you lucky it a longleaf pine and you be able to use the needles for landscaping
gardening,meanwhile in pa it snowed today lol
gardening,ooooh never seen a mantis nest
gardening,bonsai that baby
gardening,it s worth noting that sometimes meyer lemons are rooted cuttings not grafted you ll need to check the foliage on the shoots from the rootstock to see what it is trifoliate orange or citrange will have palmate compound leaves while if they were not grafted or if they were grafted onto sour orange the leaves will look like regular citrus leaves at least from the photos you posted it looks like it s either or grafted onto sour orange you ll want to scratch sniff the leaves once they open up to figure out what type they are they have distinctive aromas meyer lemon will have a lemony odor but sour orange has a sweet almost grapefruity odor on the leaves
gardening,i agree looks like cutworms the little bastards cut my marigolds last year and stunted their growth for the whole season
gardening,nice weeds b gone
gardening,when it dies every year the shoots are long thick and hollow and what i would imagine bamboo is like i get what you re saying
gardening,that s my neighbors garage i have garages acting as partial fences in my backyard but yes it is hard to kill grows incredibly fast and is just a serious pain in my ass every year i just cleaned up years worth of dead and it filled huge yardwaste bins the shoots are tough when they re dead and they almost do look like bamboo to those that said it i m in washington state so i m pretty sure we can t grow bamboo here though
gardening,says here you can but i still did it wrong
gardening,wonderful
gardening,i felt the same way when i hydroseeded my back yard and had a massive hail storm the next morning i feel you
gardening,bravo
gardening,for some reason here in dallas we have a home depot that has a garden center next door to it also braned as home depot that i think is bigger than the home depot itself
gardening,we had wind so bad half the pots blew away then it was in the and it was almost definitely hailing for a minute there
gardening,they definitely were
gardening,it is the single host plant for the caterpillars that become monarch butterflies when the milkweed is gone the monarchs will be gone as well watch for mama monarchs anxiously flitting around looking for a milkweed to lay their eggs on they have a very characteristic flight mode stopping just briefly to lay an egg and then flit around looking for another good place
gardening,so delicate i may have to grow one of these
gardening,a fruit tree says fruit
gardening,try driving on our roads for a while you feel better about things
gardening,mine are covered in plastic and ice cream containers welcome to another unusual spring
gardening,milkweed sap is poisonous the caterpillar bright stripes are a warning to predators that i do taste good usually lizards will leave them alone note that milkweed sap can be irritating to skin and do get it in your eyes
gardening,i in as well if you looking for something a little different my neighbors have a sizable quince tree the fruit is fascinating only palatable when cooked it looks a bit like pear but turns a beautiful rosy color when cooked i made a ton of quince preserves last year delicious they are ripe when they turn yellow but they stay hard as a rock really interesting fruit
gardening,was it supposed to be a fruit tree or just a tree
gardening,hey i so glad that you able to catch that i hope that your pregnancy is going well what a very exciting time for your family very happy for you alongside bringing in pests like ticks other ones such as flies can also be brought in i have several plants which i have frequently bring in and outside and i have noticed that they often small fruit fly like insects flying around sometimes certainly not a tick but still annoying
gardening,that good plants like that wo do well when they outgrow their small plastic pot and become root bound
gardening,recently on askculinary
gardening,i got one set aside just need some soil
gardening,this cider time
gardening,i had seedlings and only transplanted at that point so things turned out okay the next are putting out tons of fruit now ca wait for them to start changing color
gardening,sure as hell are fruits though
gardening,nanaimo bc my family s been eating homegrown mixed green salads every night for the last week peas are about a foot tall casually transplanted some tomatoes today sorry rest of canada
gardening,apples like to be pollinated by a different variety so do order another of these order a different one that does well in your area
gardening,can not stand that stuff smells exactly like mildew to me
gardening,is really nothing imo
gardening,this is extremely helpful thanks just downloaded the app because it a pretty mature garden from the previous owner of the house so lots of plants i have no idea how to maintain
gardening,any kind of apple tree will do even crab apple
gardening,the weird ones are the only ones the birds let me keep
gardening,truly blessed
gardening,i m in too had to cover my peppers a couple nights the other week and daytime temps have been cooler than normal but my peppers seem happy in spite of it
gardening,prune them right back will give you a little more time will also make em nice an bushy that assuming you have already done this
gardening,apparently baker seeds and my garden are not reliable data sources
gardening,i never seen one thank you
gardening,i have planted them in row and it thinned over time but bit spread in my rocky garden otherwise i do not have issues from spreading into my lawn after a blooming is over i just mown them over
gardening,i bought both of them in the beginning of march from a plant nursery when they were small i definitely did not try to grow from seeds i m not that confident
gardening,what is under the mulch it looks great
gardening,i guess i try farming my own strawberries then
gardening,bless you
gardening,i with you i just trying to figure out what i did on the first two so the graph is more boring
gardening,they look so good
gardening,daffodils are bulbs they will come back next year unless the bulb is damaged or removed from the ground we live in the south and get mosquito spray with our lawn service we just had gardenias and drift roses planted in the front beds and i have the fence in the back decorated with hanging pots full of petunias and other annuals the mosquito spray kills my plants i think it has plant oils in it that react with the sun and burn it anyway hopefully he wo spray them next month
gardening,it either an azealia or a rhododendron i leaning towards azealia
gardening,sorry that did actually answer your question the green things float on the water that is stored in the bucket if you research sub irrigated planter the benefits will become apparent like root pruning
gardening,in az fl you would need to refrigerate the bulbs for several weeks so they can experience the cold temps they need i believe you would need to refrigerate them around thanksgiving and plant between christmas and new years they considered annuals in hot climates
gardening,bless you
gardening,yes
gardening,ugh i had some little sprouts i had been watching so excitedly for like a month and a half had to go out of town for a week and i pretty sure the person who was supposed to water them straight up forgot except for right before i got home a few are still hanging in there but i still salty about it two weeks later
gardening,what technique did you use to grow it that big
gardening,so there s a plant identification app called picturethis and i used it to identify your plant based on the picture you posted it said it s a southern indian azalea and it also had an alert that said the plant pictured has been damaged by lace bugs it says the white and yellow dots stippling is the affected area that leaves might be falling sooner than they should and that if you look at the fallen leaves you might see insects with lacy wings and tiny drops of big feces edited to add it can be caused by insufficient light water or nutrients or by introducing a contaminated plant
gardening,i only have garlic in the ground from last fall i meant to get potatoes in but the weather and my schedule are not playing nice together
gardening,grobucket sip system in a general bucket
gardening,i threw wildflower seeds out to try and emulate my girlfriend s parent s hill i can t tell if the tiny little green nibs coming up are weeds or them sprouting
gardening,you can t grow new onions from an existing onion you can only grow new onions from seeds or sets
gardening,i got a bag of tulips from a friend like years ago i noticed last year that less of them grew up and this year i had maybe tulips left from planted
gardening,oh this is exciting congrats
gardening,i grow my shit inside i dont care about our nonsense weather
gardening,i ve never soaked my seeds in water i guess this is a thing i learn something new every day
gardening,that s the plan but this box is for herbs i m placing my tomato s in hanging baskets to save space
gardening,i ve gotten a few of those especially the first year after planting i pick them off so the plant doesn t expend precious energy developing weird fruit
gardening,ah yes the cum trees
gardening,the leaves look wrong for bamboo though
gardening,looks good grow yourself some tasty tomatoes
gardening,japanese knotweed unfortunately super invasive and difficult to kill the shoots at that size are edible and similar to rhubarb in flavor so at least it good for something even if it pretty evil otherwise that also looks super close to your foundation which can cause issues i avoid any sort of chemicals if at all possible but knotweed is one thing that will respond to almost nothing else sadly
gardening,looks like bamboo
gardening,could that be japanese knotweed
gardening,they re so pretty
gardening,same concept home depot dose have crappy wood you just have to ask
gardening,take out the fire and make the road construction and you got tennessee i like to call third winter blackberry winter
gardening,parts of boards parts of boards for the legs use screws not nails or the wood will split
gardening,you gon na need a bigger pot than that plastic one eventually
gardening,i did some light pruning last year but nothing substantial we did add seed and fertilizer around the roots to address some bald lawn at the base of the tree so maybe that made an impact
gardening,that something to think about for sure the weather patterns here are increasingly unpredictable sometimes it drought sometimes it floods i try to protect the potted ones as much as i can but they still freak too the slightest shock all of mine yellows drops leaves screams like only plants can any tips on how to best encourage a deep healthy root system with an unpredictable biome at least mine survived the freak freeze we had here i lost my meyer lemon some sago palms
gardening,ah i m sorry but i bet they do great next year mine didn t really do great until year this year
gardening,target had these too but they were white spruce
gardening,mine have yet to pop out from the bare root
gardening,yeah but i dont like the other ones ive seen coast redwoods and they look amazing
gardening,whoa literal leeches are we sure it s not bunnicula
gardening,will be fun to mow that d
gardening,how do you have plants of this size already i just getting seedlings now
gardening,happiest of birthdays to all of us d
gardening,someone cut roses from my yard before i am so sorry for your loss i would be furious too
gardening,i ve never been able to get them past the roots
gardening,he is just trying to help d
gardening,this i m breaking down and going to a nursery tomorrow really feels like i m cheating
gardening,good observation it seems to be slowly happening to all the fronds though i just took a picture of the worst one it looked real healthy when it was put in about two months ago and we do spray anything unless you think it was some kind of plant vandalism
gardening,happiest of birthdays to us d
gardening,asdfghhj mystery hosta showing up outta nowhere making me look like a damn fool
gardening,aw i feel you
gardening,those catbirds are next level crazy maybe try painting some rocks red like someone else suggested and see if you can outsmart them
gardening,well now that s even more of a surprise
gardening,not that hard for the rest of us noun pesticide plural noun pesticides a substance used for destroying insects or other organisms harmful to cultivated plants or to animals noun herbicide plural noun herbicides a substance that is toxic to plants used to destroy unwanted vegetation
gardening,indeed happy birthday hope it s been a great day for you too
gardening,also bleach
gardening,i keep telling myself to do this but the procrastination game is strong with this one d
gardening,i love those very much i haven t had one in many years and now i m really wondering why to the store
gardening,i live in the high desert we do have a lot of rabbits in the urban areas we mostly have jackrabbits and hares and they tend to stay around the higher elevations when i lived in the midwest we had bunnies everywhere but i do even see many squirrels around my area now i guess that one pest i can check off kind of thinking it might be snail season
gardening,good luck and if they don t do well or put out much fruit this year they ll probably do better next year mine did
gardening,great question i would say generally they re much however i m not a fan of the everbearing type which these are because these seem more tart i think the flavor of normal strawberries is much better but the problem with them is they only fruit once a year and somehow i never get any because critters all this with the caveat that i do not like strawberries from the store at all so even the more tart everbearing ones are better imo really i think everything home grown is so much better farmers markets are a second best grocery stores are meh after growing your own anything hope that helps
gardening,beautiful did you do anything different in two years fertilizer pruning music tips appreciated
gardening,it s awesome
gardening,i have a handful of small american hybrid sunflowers left i ca imagine my rage if someone took it in some light it is flattering that people are jealous but still not cool
gardening,start bombing the grounds with wild flowers that will show them now you have beautiful flowers all over the place jerks
gardening,your expression is spot on
gardening,i hate to say that is not a sunflower
gardening,where i am all the wood is super overpriced ended up getting rough cut lumber from a local place on the cheap
gardening,so good seeds technically but they do taste like nuts one of the main ingredients in traditional pesto
gardening,okay fair enough i would plant it too close to the house
gardening,i see my father water the flowerbed with water mixed with so much miracle gro fertilizer that it looks like while letting excess water run to the storm drain i m going to have to tell him about the fertilizer runoff issue now
gardening,home depot cheap lumber man can you send me some all joking aside this is beautiful did you make any specific blueprints for it
gardening,it cool to see another cyclamen houseplant
gardening,you just have to look around or ask this is a board not good quality but it dose the job for a temporary box
gardening,mine never said it would be a fruit tree just a sapling the one we got says red pine which get feet tall we don t have space that but i will put it in a pot and see if it ever develops bonsai potential
gardening,that is so beautiful
gardening,seems like it going to pull through
gardening,a home depot that has cheap wood where is this magical place
gardening,it smells really good
gardening,they should be fine probably just got a little more sun than they were ready for
gardening,get some bt killer and put it in a little tray of water and put like an inch of playground sand in the tops of your pots should clear them right up
gardening,disappointment is kinda like a bitter fruit
gardening,two days hitting at night my blueberries are not happy planted some annuals that look very questionable now too
gardening,i grow mammoth sunflowers and i always afraid someone will come in my yard to cut one a foot wide flower is tempting i sure
gardening,super jealous
gardening,perfect
gardening,thanks i went for the toothpick and cup of water method but that was purely because this is my first try and i wanted to see it as it happened you take the pit out of an avo peel the dark skin off carefully optional but prevents it rotting into the water i used the tip of a fine knife and took my time face the flatter broad side down and poke in toothpicks at degrees toward the top of the seed so that with will sit on the rim of a cup and hold the seed a bit below the top of the cup fill it up with water to cover about an inch of the seed it should look like this over the first weeks the seed slowly split in two held together in the middle and from that middle part a tap root slowly grew down once it was about inches long no stem growth for me at that stage i moved it to the soil in a very tall pot to give the tap root room i left just the tip exposed as you can see in my post if you leave it to grow as is after many years it will fruit and probably taste horrible i believe is good i will cut the whole plant off when the stem is approaching thick leaving just of stem sticking out of the soil then i will take a cutting of a similar thickness branch of fresh growth from a mature tree of my target type of avo i like hass and will do a cleft graft once it heals and hopefully takes all future growth will have hass genetics and as it is a scion from a mature tree it will also fruit years sooner this is all in theory i never done it before this is a bit of a hail mary just for fun i going into winter now though so time to buy a small grow light so it does die after all my love i gave it sorry for the wall of text i like to be thorough haha
gardening,looks good and probably smells good
gardening,sometimes they come up the next year i direct sowed some last spring and they re only just coming up now don t give up
gardening,i have one that looks almost exactly like yours growing in a pot and a few older ones in a much larger pot that are close to feet tall now
gardening,as a michigander i agree and am saddened

gardening,how wonderful i love tomatoes looks like you got a bit of leaf miner action going on on the bottom leaves i recommend removing the bottom leaves when you apply water water the soil and avoid wetting the leaves because wet leaves can lead to fungal diseases happy gardening
gardening,this is why it cracked me up too i went to sign up and they were gone link i looked it up the wording i was wrong april for earth day lowe will give out tree saplings just don t plant it close to a house
gardening,i was hoping it was a fruit tree but the sign up never said it was just said tree giveaway so i assumed fruit
gardening,lol she was so excited to be buried
gardening,check your neighborhood if possible other compatible apples in the area will pollinate
gardening,nice i d love to get one to actually grow
gardening,lol you got a fruit tree as well these trees get huge form plant close to your home
gardening,eventually the mulch will break down and you can level it then if you want
gardening,there she goes what a beautiful surprise i so happy for you
gardening,date night dinner
gardening,they are basically a weed
gardening,which is not far from the actual quality of plants sold by big box stores
gardening,they are the same like all tomatoes you should be able to sort out the orientation once you get true leaves if you have a variety of stuff in there
gardening,happy to help
gardening,a little green is better than no green at all all good things take time
gardening,pinecones are my favorite fruit
gardening,i so jealous it hurts
gardening,the fact that the southern hemisphere uses this sub kills me i get so jealous
gardening,it is much easier to get the right plant than to force a plant to not grow to its potential size take a look at conifers that do get that size dwarf plants perhaps or find a different kind of tree altogether that will top out at feet a redwood will probably bust right through the pot and keep growing
gardening,im just trying to grow some fucking bermuda grass in and its going back into the sixties you guys have snow
gardening,i wouldnt stress to much you can always level the ground in the area adding more mulch as time goes on i would just dig the planters themselves in level
gardening,i got the same one and they gave me a card saying its a loblolly pine
gardening,it can become a weed very easily
gardening,that product specifically or any bagged rose i got a bagged rose a climbing one called a fiesta rose and it did okay for a year and a half and then practically exploded and is now very happy
gardening,yeah that s the misdirect link totally different plan
gardening,cut worms horrible
gardening,oh my as a data nerd and a plant nerd this makes my heart sing
gardening,every year my hydrangeas bloom early and really struggle through the cold snaps they are looking so good this year
gardening,yeah i not good at reading directions either
gardening,ugh that loblolly is clearly a gymnosperm
gardening,it opens at midnight eastern time since i central i sign up at
gardening,garlic tree
gardening,i m new to the gardening world this area of our place was completely run over by weeds i pulled em out by hand i found that putting cardboard and mulch on top will help prevent weeds i did not level the ground before putting cardboard down and it s not even cardboard is still there see the right side where it s white i bought two metal garden beds do i have to level the ground before setting them up
gardening,i was seriously sad mine were taken multiple weeks without me getting one of the this cracked me up so bad thank you sooooo much for posting you made my evening
gardening,i glad you got a fruit tree at least
gardening,i just sitting here on vancouver island laughing i do miss you ontario
gardening,thank you they re totally hidden under my japanese maple tree i m the only one who knows they re there it makes me smile when i wander the yard and see them peaking out
gardening,i feel like the best natural fertilizer is compost i just bought a subpod and i ca wait to start using it you could also search for a local farm in your area that sells worm castings worm poop lol because that will make your soil extra nutritious as well
gardening,the soil made it be bone dry up top making me not realize it was soaking wet the bottom of the pot yes all pots had proper drainage i did water for weeks before i checked and the soil was still super wet
gardening,they told me it a scottish pine we are giving ours away to a friend who has a big yard i do have space for the size it will become
gardening,ask all you like it just that sometimes it quicker to search than get different answers
gardening,yea we had it prettychilly the last nights too not as cold as you tho
gardening,first year with a greenhouse i laughed at the snow yesterday
gardening,oh wow k thanks
gardening,thank you for sharing your knowledge
gardening,try this
gardening,i have not transplanted it yet that s on my to do list for tomorrow though
gardening,i love your tulips they re a gorgeous color
gardening,that actually the corm i think similar to a bulb it basically the bottom of the plant
gardening,i got something called a tangy green urban apple after looking it up it needs another variety to pollinate the cool thing i read about is it does get very tall and stays in a column i going to try to order at least another one for the pollination i guess that is how they get you to spend money
gardening,awesome thank you
gardening,your lettuce and peppers look very good we had snow and temps at for the last nights next week in the
gardening,it sounds like rabbits they are in many urban areas
gardening,well it looks more like cilantro to me no matter what it is it wants a larger pot did you just transplant it sometimes plants go into shock and faint for a day or two directly after transplanting
gardening,moved a couple years ago and kept seeing a full parking lot at a nursery across the street from an orange store took me until last fall to visit thinking it was out of my price range now i there every week because they have grown plants cheaper than the stuff and you know it will grow because they grow it all there less than a mile from my house
gardening,yep miami i cuban
gardening,yep i in miami and i cuban
gardening,lucky my tomato seedlings are tall and it been snowing for days
gardening,need some van dike tulips
gardening,it may be worth a mention usually heavy sucker growth from the roots means there is stress or a rejected graft a last ditch effort to save itself
gardening,oh interesting this is our first go with establishing fruit trees these were purchased during bare root season should we bring this to the attention of our nursery
gardening,each stalk can produce a banana rack but once that individual stalk is harvested it won t flower again however the large underground corm will send up new shoots that backfill the now finished stalk so far i have only read about this process and this banana plant is my first oldest to flower
gardening,lots of jelly and cider in future
gardening,google native perennial plants for your region ask at your local nursery
gardening,actual fall lasts like days before hello darkness my old friend comes along
gardening,no need really bonus here my starter mix and i share why i am putting this in here at the end dry compressed coconut coir hydrated expanded about gal perlite vermiculite worm castings the reason i adding this recipe is the worm castings have humic acid which aids germination and naturally buffers the starter mix
gardening,it seems to finally be warming up here in colorado at least first few weeks of april i was in shorts after work and then it pretty much snowed here for two straight weeks
gardening,google what flowers grow wild locally to you and plant those
gardening,my gf got the same thing came here to find out what it is
gardening,very nice
gardening,this i needed to see this the context is even more glorious
gardening,any issue with chiggers
gardening,then it looks like you were made for each other lovely
gardening,unfortunately you may begin to experience such oddities in climate and weather if we do do something soon
gardening,thank you for this tip moved from central ca to ny a couple years ago and i trying to figure out when it safe i planted worth of ferns and bleeding hearts a week ago and had to create with tomato cages and plastic to keep them viable for the past couple days think they should be okay after tomorrow but the weather changes every minutes in rochester
gardening,squirrels where i live are like ya i m gon na take those thanks
gardening,i ve had them fermented and simmered in a syrup for like a day or something like that it was the last course at a restaurant and i was too drunk to remember
gardening,hi i recently moved into a house with a nice lot but the soil is terrible in the mid atlantic area if that helps however i have a big area in the back of my lot where leaves have been dumped for years it also near a small creek my lot slopes down toward the creek the soil under and around the leaves is very rich can i use that soil in my garden how do i prep it should i be worried about and how do i get rid of those thanks a million
gardening,put it in a pot and see what happens
gardening,winter creeper
gardening,this is amazing the formed concrete look is so pleasant to look at
gardening,i believe that one is called wildfire i get all my roses from jackson and perkins so far i have three climbers floribunda hybrid tea and one english if i remember correctly the lighter ones yellows whites didn t open up yet
gardening,good to remember i knew things pollinate in differernt ways i forgot about this one thank for the reminder
gardening,may be a graft failure
gardening,tidy tips
gardening,the seeds came from my mom s trees back home i ll get more the next time she sends a care package of loquats and i ll try again once i move
gardening,looks like you about weeks ahead of me i zone and austin where are you
gardening,i did know they had wax til the sun had melted some of it off felt like a goober
gardening,that awesome
gardening,sorry to be gross but semen they smell like semen
gardening,ok they were dry so maybe just more water since we had some hot days this week i planted it back in early march
gardening,great i be trying that out then thank you
gardening,i just planted my first seeds today after my indoor starts almost all died
gardening,you need to put in warm water to get wax off soaking the roots helps too but local nursery is always a good move they give you good advice on planting
gardening,i just use normal potting mix for mine and only water once every weeks at the most
gardening,yeah i may buy some netting to be safe at least until they establish poor babies
gardening,that s beautiful wow
gardening,hey i m watching this episode as i just scrolled past this post
gardening,i was going to say the same i have been batting zero trying to get these spots half the time the website doesn t work for me and when it does all the spots are gone
gardening,i in southern arizona its already out
gardening,everytime i click the link i get misdirected to another plan i ve also tried googling it elsewhere to no avail tia
gardening,thank you the goofball sure lives up to his goofy name
gardening,yes hello south parker
gardening,i feel that however paraquat is a restricted use pesticide which requires a license to purchase and apply also in most states you have to have a license to apply any pesticide to another person property for compensation either way dude broke the law and ag commissioner should be able to do something i get what you saying though obviously does care about but being charged and or losing his license if he has it would go way imo
gardening,luckily it wasn t below freezing for more than hours the next day was upper or i definitely would have had some perennial and shrub damage
gardening,awesome i haven t heard of that app before i m definitely going to have some fun with that thank you
gardening,what kind of pots are those and what are the green sticks sticking out of them
gardening,use sand paper to scrape off some of the old glaze then use a spray paint color of your choice
gardening,thank you
gardening,vermi works faster vermi is called black gold because passing through the worms digestion track gives it some beneficial microbiology if i put the household scraps i do with the worm bin outside it likely attract pests
gardening,i tried using google and it came up with several that weren t that similar and i just wasn t sure so i thought i would ask for assistance i m sorry if this was the wrong sub to ask
gardening,in this little cold snap took care of my okra sprouts
gardening,i do it every year in my amazing how many are in there
gardening,i in nebraska and i planted lettuce spinach radishes leeks peas and carrots but i using grow bags so they easy to drag into the potting shed at night if i need to i got a veritable jungle of tomato pepper and herb seedlings in my office waiting for the weather to figure it shit out
gardening,northern ontario
gardening,african violet

gardening,my broccoli that has been growing since the end of march started bolting because of this weather

gardening,hey i be happy to sell you some with your preferred you can send me a pm
gardening,you dodged a bullet there some got the freeze one month after the last frost date that hurts i in and one year we had a cold june nothing frosty but the plants just sat there and it rained and rained and rained on top of that
gardening,california checking in what winter what road construction
gardening,i might think it slugs and snails they can clear a new plant to the ground in a night put out a bowl with beer in it it attracts them and they drownd in it
gardening,that fantastic to hear it so frustrating after the effort and expense of getting plants into the garden to lose them on the other hand it a real win when they come through a snap like that i had garlic with about inches of growth and it got down to degrees monday night they were under about inches of snow the tops of the leaves poking out are black and folded over but the bulk of the green growth is going to be snow is an amazing insulator
gardening,i hear ya all the way up here in zone
gardening,i sorry i just find it so cute that you counting flowers and stems it makes me think of how i wish i could feel that first feeling again lol yes absolutely put mulch especially for containers it helps keep the soil cool helps it retain moisture in turn helps keep the micro life in the soil it also keeps the fruit off the soil helping to prevent fungus and such you like that pot for strawberries if so keep them in there strawberries make new babies my putting out runners a long stem will spread and on the end will start growing a new plant just take those and put them in the new pot or area and keep the original in the original pot
gardening,i need this planter where did you get it
gardening,the springs could be truer the fire i do get though super hot
gardening,breathe real hard on it with rage breath defrost
gardening,cries in
gardening,the gardening subreddit is definitely one of the more helpful and kind ones around
gardening,i have everything mulched but i go snail hunting and see if they are part of my problem thank you
gardening,yeah for sure if they can get hours of sun that good too if they are inside for extended periods of time you can use a fan as well on low setting to simulate wind
gardening,only a few years but it fruited after the first time it flowered these are grafted onto trifolate rootstock from cuttings off mature trees so they do need the usual years to start fruiting if you do have reliable pollinators you may want to assist but otherwise i expect it will start budding after a week or so of warm sunny weather
gardening,i should have mentioned i live in an urban area we have a ton of crows pigeons and quail but no rabbit or deer i did see some bird poop we also have cats in the neighborhood would they eat plants they do poop in our yard when they pass through
gardening,it looks like a slime mold not a fungi it s am amoeboid protist doesn t do anything to your plants however if conditions are favourable for it conditions likely aren t favourable for your sprouts
gardening,i love orange and apricot colors as showpiece flowers but if you bought these mislabled then bad seller bad
gardening,wtf really i have a raging fever right now so this is for some reason super funny to me thank you op
gardening,i m trying to not only copy this design with rocks at the outer edge and mulch inside which is by our front yard porch area but i m also thinking that pushing the rocks towards the home and adding mulch in front by the shrubs and perennials would allow them to breathe easier and stay healthier longer i have the feeling leaving the landscape rocks as is will dry things out quicker
gardening,aww rats
gardening,my favorite i have half a dozen varieties myself
gardening,it s dead and lowe s has a one year warranty on their shrubs
gardening,i do mean to assume your species but its not likely that you could survive hanging upside down suspended in place over a concrete floor for very long
gardening,i bought of these lemons i repotted them right away the roots were so crowded i also don t live in a climate they like so i made sure to place them both in nice sunny locations near windows on plant stands
gardening,what would you say they smell like we have an unknown pear tree planted by homeowners ago and i swear it smells like pork rinds when in full bloom
gardening,well on the bright side i m glad you think my soil blend sounds right i ll keep an eye on them and hopefully it turns out to just be stress from transplanting them thank you very much for your help i don t post on any subreddits often but the kindness makes me want to be more involved
gardening,my father in law always says he will take some of ours because he can t get them to grow meanwhile we can t grow grass and yet bleeding hearts are our version of dandelions
gardening,if these late frosts would stop killing my plants i might be able to see these flowers in person
gardening,i was told some sort of conifer
gardening,ooooh what is the orange one
gardening,we don t have harsh winters but i m pretty sure black berry bushes die back during winter and produce more canes in the spring so i ll likely just leave them where they are
gardening,if you want to keep the rocks you can i d just make sure the plants are getting enough water and sun if they get dry easily make sure to water them with your hose a few times a week if you d prefer the rocks closer to the house i would add the mulch there which could help with water retention as well no need to add compost if nothing new is planted either way will need fertilizer so the bushes and any perennials trying to start the new season get nutrients
gardening,well it looks like it dead but try pruning back some branches and see if you see any green inside also i see that it has a lowes tag on it i do know if it would qualify but lowes has or used to have a return policy on dead plants you may want to look into the information should be on the tag
gardening,missing black fly season somewhere before and including road construction summer then recurring in false fall
gardening,i agree i hate when people let them grow to the size of baseballs bats
gardening,slugs and snails can also be devastating to new plants they have taken some of my starters to the ground before
gardening,well damn that sounds okay i d hope it s just transplant shock and they ll recover then
gardening,i taken to using colored electrical tape to label the rows
gardening,i am so jealous i wish i was covered in dirt
gardening,i love your cat s name
gardening,deer turkey rabbits chickens check for foot prints and poop that should narrow it down
gardening,they usually bloom like every years
gardening,does your area get winter and if so where will you put the containers
gardening,i know there is a lot of bad publicity about roundup but i ve yet to see conclusive evidence that it is too dangerous to use
gardening,you bought it from costco and forgot about it
gardening,if the branches do snap when ya bend em it might have some life yet cut it way back wait and see
gardening,it s a cycad that s normal and not a problem
gardening,peony
gardening,that is a seriously type a insect
gardening,i guess should be okay but i still hesitant but i imagine that could happen to you and still restart some seeds and still have a better yield than i have here in
gardening,it is easier to transplant the smaller ones but since they grow so easily from seed just collect seed and sow it where you want a patch i bet there are neighbors who will come and dig some up for their yard
gardening,they re in the lilly family if i recall correctly
gardening,bought both were covered in wax to make them keep both died in weeks went to local nursery and got some started ones that are doing fantastic just my experience
gardening,i made my own mixture as my soil last year was the worst thing i could ve possibly used this year i mixed about topsoil i bought scott s topsoil from home depot which said it has peat moss in it as well i would say about composted manure and the rest a mix between pre mixed raised bed soil perlite and bood and bone meal mixed in
gardening,one thing i love about gardening is that since some decisions have season ending consequences or limiting what you can do outcomes it really makes you second guess transplanting early next year ultimately if they happy in a with controlled light and heat no rush irregardless how optimistic you are
gardening,i seen birds eating my autumn joy sedums i always thought it was squirrels or rabbits
gardening,the leaves are nice and peppery i never tried a flower
gardening,yes i did my container garden while i rented almost all in self watering containers herbs flowers tomatoes peppers watermelons and cucumbers last year
gardening,how can i make a homemade mix for it
gardening,do you have small fan for air flow how is your moisture level the height of your light from the plant is good for seedlings imho several years of seed starting when we had a big garden
gardening,i currently have the plant in a pot it has flower and it looks like new ones coming in it will get about hours of sunlight a day then the rest is usually shade should i put mulch on top of my soil and should i transplant to a bigger after my first year
gardening,on behalf of the bumbles i thank you
gardening,i got the first gen of fiat brand from home depot they were for a fixture they have a much better selection now
gardening,drove through snow drifts in upstate ny today blegh
gardening,thank you
gardening,or here depending on elevation it snows in april at least that been true for the last years i been aware enough to keep track people never believe me come the first warm spell in march it just like winter is over how could it possibly snow again it so fun a month later saying told ya as i take a sip of coffee watching the flakes come down i even got someone else in the office doing the same thing after getting burned years ago mother day is the safe date for sure
gardening,i will have to consider something similar but i have wire fencing around our fruit trees and they still getting hit by something maybe squirrels this is what drives ppl to become hunters
gardening,i think that only applies to certain types of seeds it looks like you have a mix of several different types there remember that different types of seeds are adapted to different methods of distribution sinking would probably be detrimental for some of them some that fall on the ground right below their parent plant probably benefit by being carried by rain water coconuts specifically rely on floating to colonize new areas i ca imagine that a sunflower seed would float and looking at the shape of them it almost seems like they meant to flow on water easily just like seeds that disperse in the wind often have little built in to carry them i would worry too much about it just always overplant and thin out the extras
gardening,also canada adjacent upstate ny
gardening,what was the soil like
gardening,it s done it would ve held onto something green or sickly looking
gardening,beautiful peppers and beautiful manicure
gardening,i really like them do you sell them it would be cool to be able to get custom ones made
gardening,would compost be a lovely host to weed seedlings i do see it as suppressing weeds but it will help keep the soil cool and more moisture retentive
gardening,miracle grow is as popular with the new generation of experienced gardeners but it may be q good suggestion for new gardeners because it has fertilizer already in it the more sun the better for strawberries at least here in detroit mulch or get this straw lol is really important for all plants but especially strawberries i water mine on the same schedule as my tomatoes and peppers which is i try to do once a day the mulch will help prevent drying out they spread quite a bit a plant spread to fill a bed in its first year for me good luck
gardening,how long can plants stay in those containers before planting i buying some plants from a native plant sale may could i wait until the weekend of may to plant them in the ground or will being in the containers too long affect them this is chicago area if that matters so weather is highly variable
gardening,bee pollination declining with increased use of pesticide apnews bobby coy and his son richard coy owners of crooked creek bee in jonesboro began noticing a decline in bee pollination after nearby farmers began using the pesticide dicamba on nearby crops during the past three years it s gotten bad enough to force the coys to move their operations to southern mississippi to escape the effects of the dicamba spray the jonesboro sun reported the herbicide has been used by farmers who plant soybean and cotton crops that have been genetically modified to be tolerant of the chemical because it is effective in killing pigweed but dicamba does damage to other soybean crops along with watermelons pecans peaches tomatoes and other vegetables and other plants essential for and for migrating butterflies
gardening,my holdovers are juuuuust starting to get leaves i don t start them inside or in a garage for an early push so i was feeling desperate for some color on that patio while i wait this one was kind of boring in the store but it has really perked up since i brought it home
gardening,rabbits deer
gardening,great good luck
gardening,well said
gardening,lavender roots are very sensitive to prolonged moisture and will rot in a heartbeat it must be in sandy soil for me that meant removing a lot of my clay and replacing it with a sandy mix if you are growing in containers regular potting mix is the way to go use cactus or succulent mix or mix lots of sand in with potting mix overwatering kills more lavender than and they both cause the plant to wilt
gardening,all of mine need this right now i ve been slacking
gardening,it will be months before tomatoes start producing in my greenhouse they call missoula the garden city
gardening,same with us we re in troy al plants been out since the weekend before easter then the true easter frost came thought we were safe but it got cold last night my plants are now staring daggers at me
gardening,wow that sounds fantastic i would love to try making extract it probably would be a good way to use up my massive amount of lemon balm
gardening,yeah maybe just not sure how well it will adhere and stand up to elements paint suggestions
gardening,so what is it
gardening,i registered my monarch waystation last year so few of them on the map for nyc here s hoping more people plant milkweed in their pollinator gardens help their survival
gardening,i do start almost everything from seed so i don t worry much about that
gardening,so beautiful
gardening,what did you plant in each corner might be able to figure it out once they start growing
gardening,i enjoy citrus trees pretty easy to deal with and in my climate zone it grows almost naturally good luck
gardening,is that a nootka cypress
gardening,thankfully everything s fine because it was on for a short time and my husband got it off i know it was the plant because i got an ultrasound earlier so they were looking at my stomach all morning when i got home i was in the same spot for like hours then went to take a shower and discovered the tick
gardening,while those lilacs are small i d bring them way further out from the house or make sure you trim them back that size after they finish flowering each spring aside from the one that looks like it got a bit cold will probably bounce back tho your plants look good i think you might like the overall look better if you cleaned up the borders it can be more work but it they are clean and squared up it will make the overall effect so much nicer
gardening,we just had an incredibly late cold snap and my poor plants are struggling
gardening,i know everyone says is enough but i use a tube led fixture that and is perfect for a tray of seedlings been working well for me for years once they get more that i move them to the shelf with fixtures i also grow cilantro yr round using fixture the old addage when using grow lights was as close as you can thats still stands for florescent but with led i find too close will stunt them mine are probably inches from the babies but it depend on your fixture
gardening,the ol bait and switch
gardening,beautiful little garden we had a late frost too i am so glad they all survived for you
gardening,this is life
gardening,it is the sun per se as peonies love sun it is in a pot that is way too small which may be full of roots if it is more than a year old and it is being baked from underneath by the patio peony roots extend out at least inches from the base of the plant all around and almost that deep they do like being dry if you had a big enough pot the leaves would be over the pot and not getting hit by the heat reflected off the patio since it is already setting buds you do want to repot now but get it off the patio while keeping it in the sun and check the moisture down an inch or so into the pot and water accordingly
gardening,dang thats an i was jipped look
gardening,i have room for one tree my kids were sooooo disappointed when i got home guess i posting this on freecycle and buying something more fruit like from the nursery
gardening,i know i guess ridiculous i almost feel like i wasting seeds
gardening,omg they everywhere
gardening,blahahaha
gardening,the issue of fertilizer runoff is real and some people assume that organic is better than manufactured chemicals adding something like compost improves the soil which mg does it also adds micronutrients i do know if mg does that i live in a place with naturally high phosphorus levels adding more via conventional fertilizer can lead to phos toxicity over time one formulation for everything from tomatoes to flowers seems weird so i think that there are a variety of reasons if it works for you and you follow the instructions directions then go for it my goal is to nourish the soil so that i do need to fertilize plants
gardening,nice haul unfortunately leeches have discovered mine blood sucking strawberry stealing bastards
gardening,i glad you okay good warning we do think of that
gardening,if i waited that long my preferred nursery would have any vegetables or herbs left p thankfully i had put anything in the ground yet so they safely inside
gardening,welcome to urf
gardening,are you a vampire
gardening,how long have you had it
gardening,il looks rather dry and you should thin them out to one seedling per a cell they are most likely also in shock because they are being transferred from a closet to sunlight seedlings need hours of light a day to develop properly you could consider putting a growlight in your closet good to know i had no idea the difference in sunlight could cause shock thanks i have to look into getting a grow light since i do have any would the hours of exposure to the sun be enough though i think there about hours of sunlight in my city at this time of year
gardening,nasturtium
gardening,hoping my peonies survive this they already popped the surface so hope the burlap and stakes keep them safe
gardening,this is how i feel when someone in texas post a butterfly picture in the winter
gardening,hello does anyone know how to order these free catalogs the link is here from the united states to europe almost all of these companies declare on their websites that they are not able to ship their catalogs outside the us i find these catalogs to be very useful in a printed version because it is not only more convenient to have it at hand but also it is like encyclopedia that has a lot of inspiring and valued information and would help to plan our future garden since we do not have any friends or relatives in the united states i would like to know is there anyone who could help us with this question the ideal version would be to find a person who is planning to come to europe either to the united kingdom or norway from the us this year and could take these magazines with itself only in case there would be an extra space in the luggage but i am not sure whether it is the best idea if you have any suggestions i would be happy to hear it thank you
gardening,oh no sounds like a cat hahaha here hoping the plants stay as healthy as they can they get outside soon and your cat behaves
gardening,needs hours of sun and i do see anything wrong with it
gardening,same i do the whole plant at least in one spot to make sure the chances are that one actually grows i always end up with like a success rate and have a part time job thinning plants lol
gardening,normal do worry about it you have worse problems with lack of light if you have grow lights they should be on hours a day also if you have heat mats they should be off you want stocky plants which means cooler and brighter
gardening,three different studies
gardening,there no way marigold seeds would ever sink and i think even a tiny fraction of a marigold seeds will still grow a happy healthy plant
gardening,society garlic also smelly kinda garlicky lol but some people like it i guess
gardening,so rude gently pats you want me to send you a seedling they re borderline invasive here
gardening,keep it plant it mine grew and grew it was beautiful
gardening,i jealous i planted some milkweed seeds last winter hoping that they would germinate but nothing came up
gardening,i say no to a free bradford pear they smell awful in bloom
gardening,yours will still be gorgeous when the rest are played out
gardening,i have a soil thermometer i have no clue from year to year also i use a moisture meter for my pots because i have no clue by looking at them if they need water around june is my best guess i know i plant cucumbers and pole beans around the week of june but one june was nasty and i did get any in till july and you may say how late by october i ca stand to look at another one let alone eat them lol i make a lot of pickles by the time you on your tomato the same thing happens
gardening,i want one of these as a part of my garden but i have been able to find one i would prefer to buy the complete setup all in one so that way i can learn about them while having practice with one and then maybe buying components in different parts of another one later to put together
gardening,not technically fruit or nuts but pretty good in some pesto
gardening,mine too it seems like they have a meeting every year to decide what deer resistant plant they going to eat one year it was columbine one year lily of the valley last year it was aster apparently this year it was my lilac buds
gardening,the first and last pics look great you can cut off the lilac flowers when they done they come back next spring the second pic looks like the plant may have had some cold damage but wait and see if it recovers you doing just fine it all about trying things out and figuring out what works i had plenty of fails but it helped me learn a lot about my plants and what they like you get better and better each year
gardening,now thats a five star man
gardening,no prob good luck
gardening,no snow in but all of a sudden no sun for a week my half germinated tomato seedlings died

gardening,the idiot who wrote this study does not know the difference between pesticide and herbicide studies done by the illiterate can be dismissed out of hand peculiarly if they do know to control for the most obvious variable insecticidal soap like all soaps is a surfactant and if you spray insects with it you will kill them the rocket surgeons who unloaded this crap sprayed it directly on the bees just like is very unlikely to happen in the real world in other words in the extremely unlikely event that this has any value what so ever the only thing we could conclude is soaps can kill insects if you spray it directly on them just like the instructions on insecticidal soap say to

gardening,we lost a young clematis to ours we talk to our guys each year about a do you dare spray this lawn and b leave the daffodils until they die back they do always get the second part but the plants do get a few extra weeks and have managed to keep going hopefully yours will too what kills me is that the daffodils are in a bed outlined in rocks why would you get in there leave it be i not sure how they treat my annual flowers i putting in after the bulbs are done this year

gardening,i signed up for this thing at exactly midnight last week so i would miss it wonder what kind of fruit we get maybe
gardening,i m thinking about starting a pothos wall is this a good idea the plant doesn t seem to attract bugs
gardening,it was most likely given a growth regulator by the grower to keep it short which could be why the side flowers look a bit wonky
gardening,this
gardening,that exciting i bet they look just as beautiful
gardening,you need to prune the shoots like a degree growth is good but if a degree angle out prune that makes the plant more attractive
gardening,not for sure but possibly mummy berry
gardening,i agree with you on both counts i step on them too far less cruel the chickens would be willing helpers can chickens be trained to only look for those jumpers
gardening,fungus
gardening,clematis like lots of sun and cool roots it is recommended to mulch them to keep them cool so cold temperatures may burn the leaves but not harm the roots and they will come back
gardening,honestly it one of the reasons why i too afraid to grow anything from seeds i do have the room inside for them as is but i be heart broken over losing them as well outside even if i did have the room inside but yet i just over here trying to save my aloe from root rot and i could cry over years of work over a simple mistake so i get it even if the seeds do cost a lot it sooooo much work to get them going
gardening,wow thanks a ton i appreciate the time you spent writing this it was very encouraging and helpful i will definitely give this a
gardening,well done if you do mind me asking what is the material
gardening,here a link to a video where a guy compared a bunch of different brands of soil by planting different plants in each brand and then measured results at the end of the season you need to watch this and the follow up video to see the results
gardening,looks army worm to me wire worm would be a june bug grub i d stalks start falling over just cut at ground level then cut worm also cuteorm have a colored head where armyworm just have colored eyes
gardening,all bad seconding the commenter who said the first one are likely cutworms
gardening,these are nice but there are a lot of choices and leds last a long time i have some that are years old florescent are more hot and use more energy and the thing people do know about them is after a few months they start getting dimmer you do notice because it is so slow in happening a friend of mine is a maintenance man and he clued me into this there is a lot of good info shown so you should read it whether you are going to get these or not
gardening,how am i supposed to light them all at once
gardening,thanks so much hairy
gardening,would be perfect start at quarter strength and if they okay in a couple weeks try half strength
gardening,lol amateurs that one day in melbourne australia
gardening,i not prepared to be nearly as dismissive as you are willing to be they also reduce the surface tension of insect exoskeletons goodwin and mcbrydie however surfactants can be also toxic to such beneficial fauna in agroecosystems as pollinators goodwin and mcbrydie found that of the surfactants they tested were highly toxic to bees were these results demonstrate that organosilicone spray adjuvants that are considered biologically inert potentiate viral pathogenicity in honey bee larvae and guidelines for oss use may be warranted
gardening,snowing right now here
gardening,they recommend putting any adult worms we can find in a bag and leaving it out in the sun for at least minutes i don t know i d rather step on them the point is to kill them or torture them also i m sure chickens would enjoy the worms
gardening,is almost definitely cutworm bad but can be managed with cutworm collars and i look like wireworm google to confirm id
gardening,these are so simple yet elegant
gardening,i do remember seeing a frost this late here in like ever it way past avg last frost date go figure i probably will push back planting till may now i did have everything planted because i knew the ground needed to warm up but still sucks to lose so much didnt snow here either just a really hard frost
gardening,what type of planters house plants veggies pots these ones are for plants
gardening,starting to see more and more photos of full blooms covered in snow i m happy mine haven t broke dormancy yet
gardening,search regal geraniums or their latin name pelargonium grandiflorum some older cultivars are spring flowering while newer ones will flower all season wait for the soil to dry slightly then water thoroughly till water runs out the bottom of the pot in cool weather thats probably every few days and in the summer once or twice a day
gardening,looks like mosaic virus to me
gardening,morning glory do like cold you ca rush some things i am in zone and i do start some plants till june may is too cold and you do gain anything by planting early the plants just sit there waiting for warmth
gardening,oh no i ca wait for tomato harvest salsa sauces fresh bruschetta
gardening,thank you when does your soil temps hit consistently i m in new england and it can take awhile to get to that consistent temp
gardening,here as well i learned to not plant anything new until may my daylilies and butterfly bushes sprouted leaves a few weeks ago but we were lucky to not fully reach freezing some how my house also got skipped on snow as it snowed minutes north and minutes south of us with visible snow still on the ground high earlier than day lol
gardening,maybe a pine twig
gardening,did you harden them off before planting them out
gardening,thank you for your encouragement for a fertilizer do you suggest a diluted all around fertilizer like a or should i focus on something that promotes just root growth
gardening,that looks like a sprig of pine someone ripped off a poor tree
gardening,it s not a bong
gardening,the plant only makes bananas once right
gardening,hello canada it seems germany shares the same seasons with you ca wait for construction work to begin
gardening,spray paint
gardening,repaint it
gardening,yeah it a bloom set spray
gardening,part peroxide part water and pour on top of the soil until you get a tad of runoff it will kill them
gardening,could be wrong but the middle one looks like a wire worm bad but inevitable will eat roots and ground veggies you can catch them by leaving slices of potatoes in the soil and checking them every day they come and hangout as they chow though this is only useful for a small problem or a good way to do a kindof survey
gardening,question for my fellow canadian gardeners out here i have goji berries that have over wintered and already has flower buds did this freeze just kill my plant should i bring it inside or just leave it outside
gardening,just putting them outside too early and in direct sunlight too soon
gardening,procrastination for the fucking win
gardening,lesson learned i feel like i do this every year and forget and then this happens
gardening,fishsticks
gardening,it from bonnie
gardening,yeah they said we can t touch trees and they won t either my other neighbor has had two dead trees break off big pieces during windy days broke his fence six times and each time park said not their problem
gardening,perhaps looks like it s in fair shape now but may need trimming in time i think it s worth a knock on your neighbors door to get an ok let them know it might need to be trimmed to stay healthy or if you re lucky the town might take care of it i d call them first then a tree specialist
gardening,i think it a great opportunity to find out which friends you should cut out of your life and replace with new plants
gardening,little warrior
gardening,ontario i bet yes terrible idea to plant anything other than woody shrubs or trees prior to may weekend here my dude maybe some hardy perennials
gardening,lichen is growing on it
gardening,tried calling the city
gardening,remember back in february when of texas lost power for days due to a snowstorm that was about days after i transplanted my tomato seedlings outside
gardening,this might help also you curcubits were started too soon you should start them later so they are smaller when you transplant i just plant the seeds in the garden when it is for soil temp
gardening,i ll pm you because advertising rules
gardening,you made me think of earth as a big soggy mossy rock and now i never not think of it like that guess that literally what it is but with a lovely burning hot cream center
gardening,zone never plays in the dirt before may
gardening,the dark windy and rain less dark windy and rain less likely to be rain but probably rain oh it s not dark out no wait rain clouds suns coming out rain sun but also rain warm rain rain getting dark rain cold rain too dark to see but it s wet when i go outside
gardening,i in for the last years we been getting in the morning and during the day then in the first week of june it jumps to the and stays there until september thankfully all of my plants are indoors still however i been trying to fix some grass bare spots and the fact that it went down to last night just as my seeds began sprouting is helpful i never seen it this cold this late into spring
gardening,i live in a condo so my space is limited i cropped this picture to eliminate identifying info so as to prevent advertising just curious if anyone has tried one of these or what types of vertical garden set ups work best i would have indoor floor space which this pillar thing would work in but outdoor i have no ground space but can hang against a fence or wall like felt pocket planters gim me your best vertical garden ps happy earth day
gardening,what brand is this i like this
gardening,the last one is def a grub the first are some sort of caterpillars larva that will eat the plant from inside out the not sure about
gardening,idk what zone you in but damn pepper plants outside already in the ground not just harding off
gardening,here in i got so many tubers i want to plant i really want to believe this is the last
gardening,ha i guess that a good solution d
gardening,you can get them cheaper nowadays if you get the watt for starting seeds that is sufficient and you can get them cheap here is an example i use them and they work well and take less power than the stated also they are cooler these are even dimmable the heating pad should be turned off once the seeds sprout the extra heat is self defeating and will cause the seedlings to be leggy even with more light some people are using fans now
gardening,first rule of long life and happiness is you can ignore any study done by a moron that thinks herbicides and pesticides are the same thing and say herbicides are the most widely applied type of pesticides this study is not on the european honey bee apis mellifera on top of which they the insects in a round up solution that contained surfactants ie soap which is what most likely causing the claimed effect if any
gardening,good luck hope you succeed amigo
gardening,thays what i think too they eat at the roots as larva and eat on the rest once they pupate
gardening,so in other terms free bait this spring n summer
gardening,birmingham is right on the border of
gardening,what the heck is that lol
gardening,go to his weed and whack all of his houses
gardening,use netting on the plant to keep the birds and other critters out yon google netting for plants
gardening,i m pretty sure the white ones grow up to be june bugs
gardening,great color
gardening,if the building were strict and orderly i could get it i wouldn t start a garden just anywhere on the property but this is a retaining wall full of weeds and trash and the only thing they do to maintain it is tearing up anything i plant in there they re morons they don t even wash the walkways they just pay a guy to show up a few times a month with a leaf blower to blow the dust around i can t wait to move out of this building
gardening,anyways i took the picture outdoors but that is the first day they have been outside literally at all it been very cold where i live with this late winter
gardening,thanks a lot i ll go look for some
gardening,and deff not good they feed on the plants
gardening,there so many options not big box store for starters
gardening,thank you so much much appreciated
gardening,joe gardner on ig is in ga and he recorded a low of last night
gardening,do you recommend a grow light that holds up but wo break the bank or eat up a ton of energy bills might be good
gardening,prune just above an existing leaf bud the direction the bud is facing is the way the new branch will grow
gardening,two seasons ago they whacked our threadleaf coreopsis what i did understand is that they had to go way out of their way to do it as the part that got whacked is nowhere near the lawn needless to say angry calls were made and we quickly received a check for the damage
gardening,the white grass is most likely a sport or mutation of the green one that is growing if it is still connected to the mother plant it should survive for a while but most likely will not be able to survive on its own
gardening,i thought this was for a second
gardening,i guess sadly i can only cut whatever it s on my side my neighbor does his part but the tree itself is on city park property so we can t trim too much worth calling company
gardening,this is the first spring in a new house so i have no idea at least it not looking to b below here
gardening,you ll want a tree specialist to come trim they can make sure the tree can support its canopy
gardening,i would bigger pot loosen up the rootball and add a little bonemeal give her a chance to expand most nursery pots are close to being root bound let her relax and breathe expand her roots and grow stronger
gardening,was going off this where it s stated as chance of a frost after the date given
gardening,why are some people so against the stuff seems to work wonders with my flowers making them grow way faster even when compared to plants grown with other fertilizers
gardening,let me help you get off
gardening,i probably wrong about this but and pics look like kinds of grubs might be a nematode none are beneficial and can be destructive at various points in their lifecycles
gardening,the average last frost date is usually calculated looking at historical data for a given area for the time period in the sample half of the years had a last frost earlier than the average date and half of the years had a last frost later than the average date hence it being the average frequently people will want greater than chance that the last frost has passed before planting so they will use a later date with a higher degree of confidence for example say the average last frost date for my area based on historical data was may by may there might be a chance that the last frost has passed and by may
gardening,haha it s beautiful
gardening,lol i should say after mother s day and yeah you still need to check the forecasts and pray
gardening,should i repot soon i was hoping to keep her in what she came through the summer
gardening,i keep hearing about the blizzard western ny had on mother s day all those years ago
gardening,bipolar weather
gardening,has it bloomed before the question to me seems that it is blooming and you want to cover it for some reason could you have more details
gardening,the soil looks rather dry and you should thin them out to one seedling per a cell they are most likely also in shock because they are being transferred from a closet to sunlight seedlings need hours of light a day to develop properly you could consider putting a growlight in your closet
gardening,bigger and bigger pots for her good luck i have australian in laws and will always be insanely jealous of mil s lemon tree we re in canada
gardening,asking on could also give insight on techniques
gardening,beautiful i ve got that same by previous owners more than years ago put a deck in this year had to trim severely it s still got leaves but too early for flowers here i ll let you know how it goes if you d like
gardening,i feel you one time i lost a jasmine vine several watermelon vines and some other stuff that was clearly not weeds or lawn to our yard guy it s painful
gardening,regrowing root scraps if you buy ramps to cook with from the grocery store or farmers market and they have plenty of rootlets attached you can grow new plants when you prep them for eating cut off the bottom half inch of the bulb with the roots attached soak them in water overnight then plant them outside in a prepared garden bed spaced inches apart with the cut side up
gardening,to be fair weeks ago it was with a low of this morning it was
gardening,i had to take plants inside my house and cover plants for the first time in my entire life i live in texas the latest we ever had a freeze since i been gardening is the first week of april here we are almost to the last week and i running around putting as many plants as i can inside and thanking all that is holy that i accidentally ordered an extra roll of plastic when i did the blackberries i was able to cover my little tomato and pepper seedlings in one sheet i used trash bags to cover the less than a year old wisteria and the peach tree we started from seed last year and my poor purple prickly pear that all but one pad turned to mush from our horrible winter this winter has been the worst i can ever remember it like a bad ex that keeps dropping by for that one last thing they forgot i swear
gardening,looks like mild sunburn possibly in combination with some cold damage peppers and especially anything in the squash family are very sensitive to cold the soil looks somewhat dry too regular consistent watering is necessary for optimal growth slowly adjust them to outdoor conditions keeping them only in the shade at first then slowly allow them more and more direct sun over the course of a week also giving them some fertilizer mixed at half strength would be very beneficial overall your plants look great though i be proud of they were mine
gardening,my old people gardening friends are all eyeing next week to plant i think i gon na follow their lead
gardening,starts and also forced bloom ones at mine the fuchsias are usually on carts outside the garden center gate so they re not very obvious if you have gone there through the main store fm has had some really excellent plants in general sometimes i feel guilty buying there instead of my local independent place but the fm prices are better for plants that are just as good
gardening,hey fellow did the same thing with zinnias and sunflowers put the seeds in thinking it was time lol i lived here my whole life i should know better
gardening,nah
gardening,in carolina about two years ago spring started in march at about and super humid
gardening,it was snowing pretty good today in ontario canada but definitely construction season is in full swing

gardening,shit happens i wish your plants do die too
gardening,my first citrus i do not live in a climate they like indoor and out door will be her life i do plan to treat her well
gardening,thank you very much got several more bushes but they are still buds at the moment and haven t opened
gardening,this
gardening,true annoying but not unusual it did the same thing a year ago today in my area
gardening,it is a fertilizer from the company foxfarm the bag i use is called happy frog soil conditioner which is supposed to add more nutrients to your soil i have had tons of luck with it in my raised beds tried it out after many attempts to get the quick and ez seed starters to work i too have a gate around the grass otherwise my dogs would be digging it up those little bastards i hope i do have to replant it after it is done though lol
gardening,i ve never thought about fm for plant ll have to give them a look
gardening,what exactly did you do that makes you ask if you killed them
gardening,all our container veggies and flowers from the patio were brought inside except for the huge tote we use like a raised bed too heavy so we covered it with a sponge bob comforter and made wire hanger hoops left it covered both days uncovered this morning to find our first pepper bloom and first tomato bloom we had tomato and pepper seedlings he had already put in the ground just off patio so i covered them with glass jars since they were only inches high every single one of them made it and we got snow and were in the overnight twice the lavenders that had to be left out and looked so very angry even they are right as rain so very lucky
gardening,go forth and do good lemon friend i hope you have the climate to support your new acquisition
gardening,i read the question wrong ve there about months now
gardening,i have a bunch of starts from fred meyer s fuchsia extravaganza too fred meyer is actually my favorite fuchsia source they have some amazing ones even some marked as annual survived the winter including the one that was my hanging basket and first fuchsia purchase last year
gardening,me too they came with the house and we moved in years ago
gardening,i thought my husband and i reached a compromise by finding a broadleaf herbicide that is not reported to impact insects only to discover that it is suspected that the soap we added to the herbicide is what would be detrimental doubly devestating as i routinely mix dish soap with neem oil
gardening,same zone different state says between may to may
gardening,and this is how i got thrips on my house
gardening,it s fine it is literally impossible to stop worms from being in north america at this point they are so widespread that they are practically naturalized it s like well this is what happened now we just need to live with it
gardening,did you harden them off or just put them outside i also agree much to big a pot and too much water peat wicks water out so if you use them you have to be careful to water well and let dry i had small plants in small cells dry out last week two peppers shriveled i transplanted them with the others into pots and now i ca tell which they were dry is better than mud you just soak them and they should come back also they do look like they got much light you should get grow light you keep it on for hours a day so led is best
gardening,not so lucky in puyallup had to buy starts last weekend at earthworks got em in the greenhouse until it warms up again
gardening,yeah this cold front is ruining my pepper plants
gardening,i loved looking at your pics while creating your outside beautiful
gardening,are you up there
gardening,we just had a surprise snow where i live it all melted before the day ended but i think it s safe to say we are in actual spring now but can never be too sure in the midwest
gardening,i think it a nutrient deficiency i guessing magnesium or potassium not sure which lol the cucumber is really growing like crazy and has a lot of fruits but the zucchini just kind of gave up so we see if it can recover
gardening,those eyes
gardening,i sorry to hear hopefully they do come back next year and more prettier then ever
gardening,as much as he hates my plants i wonder why he even got into the yard business
gardening,i doing some research and i think it is magnesium or potassium deficiency apparently with an iron deficiency the new growth comes in pale and the old growth stays green the magnesium and potassium deficiencies both show the brown dried papery leaves too
gardening,if the soil is allowed to dry out that causes problems but that all i got i had years where the cucumbers just up and die and i do know why either than the next year i get a ton i doing eureka this year as they are supposed to be very disease resistant
gardening,i didn t do much i put seeds in potting soil months ago and recently started bringing them outside for a couple of hours a day i m in so the opportunities have been slim no fertilizer or any type of feed
gardening,go to his house with a weedeater and wack all of his plants
gardening,it turned out well
gardening,did you bring them inside love how full they are
gardening,i wanted to know if watering plant will make soil wet and cause issue to foundation
gardening,are they i did remember what kind i planted so was pleasantly surprised
gardening,lives in minnesota yep samesies
gardening,i love how these spread my goal is to create a garden like your grandma beautiful and a little bit wild
gardening,those look stunning good work
gardening,i usually water some chelates iron into the soil but also do a foliar spray i m doing this on mango trees so your might differ
gardening,looks like the sun is burning them they should adapt and bounce back if it is the sun
gardening,yes i have a bunch of them for years on some what bothers you
gardening,here and people around are aggressively saying long may long may wait til long may
gardening,the first picture is the day they were planted and as you can see they looked fine the other pics are today when i got home from work and looked at them i planted them with a sprinkle of fertilizer epsom salt and some mycorrhiza
gardening,there a face
gardening,i gave it some iron that will show up just in the new growth right we see how it goes
gardening,yeah we got got up in edmonton
gardening,ours stuck man i so sad
gardening,that could be e difference try hitting it with some iron chelate
gardening,they only bloom on new growth if you have pruned you have to wait for next year new growth read up on it
gardening,what a pretty and looking variety
gardening,im kind of working with a tight budget here so a grow lamp might be cost prohibitive at least to buy a quality one that wo break it seems so i not sure if i could do that but i might just start putting them outdoors sooner since it warm out
gardening,i really lucky that the management of my apartment complex is extremely lenient with me and my gardening the person a couple tenets before me planted some mint and a beautiful bleeding heart plant two years ago they decided to hire a company to clean the outside of the buildings they decided a bleach solution was the best idea the mint bounced back but the bleeding hearts have never been able to recover properly that aside they leave me be with how much i pushed my bounds i know i be just as crushed as you if they came up while i was gone and wrecked everything i am truly sorry for your loss
gardening,if all you doing is starting seedlings over weeks until they go into the garden you can get by very cheap shop lights that are fluorescent or led will work ideally get or higher temp rating as a rule of thumb you want watts of draw per square foot if using led per square foot if fluorescent this assumes you can distribute the light evenly across your plants the fancy grow lights are not necessary for seedlings
gardening,we ca troubleshoot your procedures until you tell us what you did what did you do
gardening,yeah cinder blocks are really cheap here even cheaper when you find a dozen of them on the side of the road down the street
gardening,in order to have effective led lights you need to pay at least the cheap desk lamp grow lights for are bright enough you do need a warming pad for houseplants discussions of lighting
gardening,i in massachusetts and it literally snowed last year on this exact day so last year
gardening,can t do much about the sun fading clr cleaner ought to take care of the mineral deposits
gardening,will be really satisfying when it blooms and you reap the reward for your patience
gardening,there are no roses that will survive the polar vortex other than that see the master gardeners at the county extension office for a list of cultivars that do well locally
gardening,yes i amended the soil with granular fertilizer before planting and have been fertilizing with neptunes harvest the black beauty zucchini i have planted next to the cocozelle has really dark green healthy leaves maybe it is in competition with the cocozelle edit i also gave the cocozelle some epsom salts for magnesium and an iron supplement recently
gardening,cover it for frost only if the temps are going to get colder than about for overnight
gardening,same area we nearly wait until memorial day
gardening,because i like to watch things grow
gardening,it may have been lollipopped its lower limbs lopped off in order to give it a more type of appearance the shade underneath it is intense and very little will grow there other than a few weed species so unless your proposed planting area is out to the side in the sun what goes under it is the carpet of needles
gardening,thanks i am likely noy going to grow too much in containers we do have about sq ft so id like to plant in soil i will check pink puhly grass i tend to love modern arvhitectural plant designs which seem more appropriate for medditerranean weather
gardening,yeah but op is in canada and all of canada is north of me
gardening,i feel you we had the goddamn snow a couple days ago on all my sprouts and buds i got high and everything worked out
gardening,we have had some colder weather i in houston so we went from weather in the to a week of and its in the in the morning the cocozelle was looking bad before the cooler weather though i think the soil may have been drying out i thought the zucchini were ok because the leaves never looked but i started watering the cocozelle more because i thought that might be the issue
gardening,sunlight do you compost
gardening,looks like nutrient deficiency have you fertilized or properly amended your soil
gardening,thanks and yes i hate hostas too lol
gardening,i totally does it s not edited at all the light was shining straight down and the brick wall is in shade unexpected artsy photo lol
gardening,snip off the two smallest and weakest at soil level with a pair of tiny sharp scissors do yank snip sunflowers with a tap root do not transplant well if you want more plants get more pots and start more seeds
gardening,your flowers are dreamy
gardening,buy a cutting if you can why wait
gardening,the sun is out today so that something
gardening,hey guys i having some curcurbit problems the first pic is my squash cocozelle zucchini it is planted next to a black beauty and earlier in the season the cocozelle was outgrowing the black beauty and was super healthy now it not looking so hot i had thought the problem was cucumber beetles but i only seen in my whole garden and never on this plant i do know if they do secret night time feeding but i think if they caused this much damage to the plant i would have seen some on it at some point now i am thinking it might be a watering issue i have started watering the plant more often but am kind of confused because the black beauty next to it is thriving with the same watering the second pic is of my cucumber that plant seems very healthy and the longest vine is about feet at this point and it has set several fruits i just noticed today some of the lower leaves have this mottled look and am worried it might be starting to do whatever the zucchini is doing thanks so much for any advice
gardening,its permanent damage you have to wait for new growth to cover it but those areas are dead
gardening,thanks for the advice might get a container that a better fit and put them outside again instead of growing them by a window this is my first time literally growing anything and i do know anyone who gardens so i was a little misguided here
gardening,in monty don last book he hammers it home you ca cheat the seasons
gardening,unless the fence is like feet tall and is solid concrete or wood it does cast that much shade at its base no matter which way a mixed perennials bed is oriented tall things go in the back medium things in the middle and short things in the front the way that you stand up children for a concert with the tall ones in the back and the small ones in front so a perennial border along a southern fence line running from east to west would have the tall things against the fence the south side of the border and the shortest things in front the north side of the border the rule about putting tall things across the north end applies more to things that are drastically taller than their friends such as cucumbers on a trellis and bean plants most perennials are pretty similar in size except for things like hollyhocks so there not a lot of shading that goes on the fence is more of a shade factor depending on what kind and size it is
gardening,have you been hit with the cold weather do you keep the soil moist
gardening,yeah me my husband just kinda threw our hands up like we tried it s our first
gardening,nope haha oklahoma so not too far away
gardening,i transitioning to everbearing in strawberry pots i do have tons of room and lots of plants so having plots with strawberry plants all season is not practical for me
gardening,so pretty
gardening,i think it s chance of frost after that date
gardening,my understanding is that the caterpillars eat it and it kills them
